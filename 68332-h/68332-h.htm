<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>: This book is a complete story
in itself, but forms the ninth volume in a line
issued under the general title, “The Second Rover
Boys Series for Young Americans.”</p>

<p>The volumes issued in the First and Second
Series so far number twenty-eight, and of these
the publishers have already sold <em>over three million
copies</em>! To me this is an astonishing number,
and I must confess that I am tremendously pleased
over the way in which the boys and girls, as
well as their parents, have stood by me in my
efforts to entertain them.</p>

<p>In the initial volume of the First Series, “The
Rover Boys at School,” I introduced my readers
to Dick, Tom and Sam Rover and their friends
and relatives. This book and those which immediately
followed related the adventures of the
three Rover boys at Putnam Hall Military Academy,
Brill College and while on many outings.</p>

<p>Having graduated from college, the three
young men established themselves in business in
New York City and became married to their girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
sweethearts. Dick Rover was blessed with a son
and a daughter, as was likewise his brother Sam,
while Tom Rover became the proud father of
twin boys. As the four youths were of a lively
disposition, it was considered best by their parents
to send them to a boarding school, and in
the first volume of the Second Series, entitled
“The Rover Boys at Colby Hall,” I related what
took place while they were attending that institution.
From Colby Hall the scene was shifted to
“Snowshoe Island” and then to stirring adventures
while “Under Canvas.” Then the boys
went “On a Hunt” and later to “The Land of
Luck.” Then came further adventures at “Big
Horn Ranch,” at “Big Bear Lake,” and then when
“Shipwrecked,” where we last met them.</p>

<p>In the present book the scene is laid first during
the final days at Colby Hall and then on Sunset
Trail in the far West. The boys had good times
and also some strenuous adventures, all of which
are related in the pages that follow.</p>

<p>Once more I wish to thank the young people
for their interest in my books and for the many
pleasing letters they have written to me. I trust
that the reading of these books will do them all
good.</p>

<p>Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Edward Stratemeyer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED ON THE LAKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Some baseball game, if you ask me!” exclaimed
Andy Rover, as he threw his cap high
into the air in satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Jack had the whole bunch from Longley guessing
from the start,” added Andy’s twin brother,
Randy Rover.</p>

<p>“What got me was the way Tommy Flanders
was batted out of the box in that fatal sixth
inning,” put in Captain Fred Rover. “It was
worse than the time we batted him out before,”
and he grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t give me too much credit for
winning that game,” came modestly from Major
Rover, as he smiled at his cousins and the other
cadets of Colby Hall who were with him, all
togged out in their natty baseball uniforms. “Remember,
I made only one of the eleven runs we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
got. Fred made two and so did Dan, while Gif
brought in three.”</p>

<p>“Of course we all helped, Jack,” returned Gif
Garrison, the captain of the Colby Hall nine.
“But what counts big with us is that you held
Longley down to a sum total of one big goose
egg. Wow! that’s enough to keep them off the
diamond for a year or two.”</p>

<p>“And I hope it does,” came from Spouter
Powell, who had gone with the team as a substitute.
“Remember, our team has got to be thoroughly
reorganized next season, with Jack and
Fred and Gif dropping out.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing that Colonel Colby didn’t
enforce that rule he was going to put through
of keeping officers out of athletic contests. If
he had done that, we’d have been minus Jack and
Fred for this game.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! how I’m going to miss old Colby Hall,”
sighed Fred Rover. “At first I thought graduating
and getting away was going to be fine. But
when I think of what we’re going to miss in
baseball and football and in the gymnasium and
on the campus—well, I’m not so sure,” and his
face clouded.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we can’t be cadets and schoolboys
all our lives,” consoled his cousin Jack. “Just
the same, I’ll hate to give up baseball, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
hate to give up being major of the school battalion,
too.”</p>

<p>“How the Longley Academy fellows hated to
see that silver trophy going to us,” put in Phil
Franklin, who had gone along as scorer. “Some
of the fellows looked as black as a thundercloud
when the committee wrapped it up in that cloth
and turned it over to Gif.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the fellows from Hixley High
and Columbus Academy felt just as bad,” came
from Spouter Powell. For the trophy was one
which had been fought for by four of the schools
on and in the vicinity of the lake.</p>

<p class="noi">chanted Andy Rover gayly. “I don’t see why
Colonel Colby can’t add a Chair of Baseball to
the curriculum,” he added, with a grin. “We’d
have a whole lot of professors to fill it.”</p>

<p>The cadets from Colby Hall were on their way
to the boat-landing, where they intended to embark
on several motor boats which were to take
them across Clearwater Lake to where the military
academy they attended was located. Behind
them came a motley collection of other cadets and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
spectators in general, including not a few girls
from Clearwater Hall. Two of the members of
the ball team—the second baseman and the right
fielder—carried between them an object carefully
wrapped in a bit of dark cloth. This object
was a tall silver vase beautifully engraved. It
had been put up as a prize by the owners of the
rival institutions of learning on the lake, and
now, having been won three times by the Colby
Hall nine, had become the permanent property
of that organization.</p>

<p>“What will we do with the vase, now we’ve
won it?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Better melt it up and make souvenirs of it,”
suggested Randy Rover, with a smile. “Each
cadet might get a medal the size of a quarter,
stamped, ‘In Memory of the Time that We Licked
Longley out of Its Boots,’” and at this there was
a general laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to put it in that glass case
in the gymnasium along with the other Hall
trophies,” said Gif. “It doesn’t belong to any
one in particular, you know. It belongs to the
whole school.”</p>

<p>When the cadets reached the lake front they
began to separate because the various motor boats
were tied up at different landings. As the four
Rover boys went forward they heard a girlish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
cry behind them and, turning, saw four young
ladies hurrying toward them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Wait a minute!” cried Ruth
Stevenson, a tall and exceedingly good-looking
girl, as she came up and extended her hand. “I
want to congratulate you on your splendid victory.
It was simply great!”</p>

<p>She caught the young major’s hand and
squeezed it warmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fred, to think you really won that trophy!”
burst out May Powell, another of the girls.
“Oh, I could just have hugged somebody when
I heard the good news!”</p>

<p>“Dad will be awfully glad to hear of this new
victory of yours, Jack,” said Martha Rover.</p>

<p>“I’m going to write a long letter home to-night,”
added Fred’s sister Mary quickly. “I’m
just going to let them know what real heroes
you two boys are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Mary! don’t pile it on so thick,”
interrupted her brother. “Remember, a baseball
game is only a baseball game, after all.”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” shouted one of the cadets from
a motor boat near by. “Remember, fellows, it’s
getting late and we’ve got quite a trip before
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and remember that we’ve got to get ready
for the celebration to-night,” added another cadet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we could see the celebration!”
cried Ruth Stevenson.</p>

<p>“You don’t wish it any more than I do,” answered
Jack quickly. “But I don’t see how it
can be done.” And then, after a few words more,
the boys and girls separated and the four Rovers
boarded one of the Colby Hall motor boats, along
with Gif, Phil Franklin, and half a dozen others.</p>

<p>“Who’s got the silver trophy? Where is the
silver trophy?” came from others on the boat-landings.</p>

<p>“We’ve got it safe and sound,” sang out Phil
Franklin.</p>

<p>“Well, take good care of it,” came from another
cadet. “That trophy is worth just about a million
dollars to Colby Hall.”</p>

<p>“Make it nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand,
and I’ll believe you,” answered Andy Rover
loudly, and this produced a general chuckle.
Then, one after another, the motor boats bound
for Colby Hall set off across Clearwater Lake.</p>

<p>It was an ideal day in late June, with bright
sunshine and just sufficient breeze to make the
air bracing. There had been a good attendance
at the ball game, and now the surface of the lake
was alive with all manner of craft carrying spectators
to various points on the water front. There
were canoes and rowboats, motor boats and steam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
yachts, as well as catboats and several small
sloops. From the shore, where a road ran up
and down the lake front, could be heard the
sounds from numerous automobiles and motorcycles.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet the hole in a button against the hole
in a doughnut that there won’t be much of a
celebration at Longley to-night,” remarked Randy
Rover, as the motor boat, under the guidance of
Pud Hicks, one of the school employees, proceeded
cautiously out from among the mass of
craft near by.</p>

<p>“You’ll be able to cut the gloom with a knife,”
answered his twin.</p>

<p>“And the gloomiest boy of the bunch will be
Tommy Flanders,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“I hope it takes some of the conceit out of
him,” answered Jack. “I haven’t forgotten how
he treated us when we were in camp up at Big
Bear Lake,” he went on, referring to some happenings
which have already been related in detail
in another volume.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Tommy Flanders and his bunch
will be at Longley next season,” mused Fred.</p>

<p>“I heard so,” returned Spouter Powell.
“Tommy and his cronies didn’t pass some of the
examinations last year, so they have got to hold
over another term.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Gee! I hope we pass in our final examinations,”
said Andy wistfully. “I’d hate awfully
to flunk at the last minute, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Andy!” returned his
brother. “It’s enough to give a fellow the shivers.”
The twins were given to so much fun
and horseplay that it was next to impossible for
them to buckle down to their studies, and, as a
consequence, each successive examination became
more or less of a nightmare to them.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to pass—every one of us!”
burst out Jack. “Now that the games are all
at an end, each fellow has got to buckle down
for all he’s worth. Just think of what the folks
at home would say if we failed!”</p>

<p>“I wonder what that silver trophy is worth,”
came from Phil Franklin. “It certainly is a handsome
vase.”</p>

<p>“I heard somebody say it cost over two hundred
dollars,” answered the young major of the
school battalion.</p>

<p>“Yes, and then there is a lot of engraving to go
on it, and that will be extra,” put in Gif. “Remember,
the name of the winning club and the
date of the final victory are still to be put
on it.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be fine if we could take it home
and show it to the folks,” said Fred wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t get a very good look at it,” remarked
Randy. “Phil, let’s take a look at it now while
we’re going home.”</p>

<p>“Be careful and don’t get it tarnished,” cautioned
Gif. “We want to keep that as nice as
possible until we can put it under glass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, looking at it isn’t going to hurt it any,”
answered Andy.</p>

<p>As the motor boat bounded on its way across
Clearwater Lake in the direction of the Colby
Hall dock, Phil and Randy, assisted by Andy,
took the dark cloth covering off the tall silver
vase and set the trophy up on the forward deck
of the motor boat where all might inspect and
admire the object.</p>

<p>“Gee, it certainly is a peach of a vase!” exclaimed
Randy, as he and his twin brother turned
the object around and inspected it closely.</p>

<p>“It certainly is an art to turn out a vase like
this,” answered Fred, who was also looking the
object over. “Just look at that curve to the top,
will you? And that little vine that trails around
and down to the bottom? Why, you can see
every leaf just as plain as if it was real!”</p>

<p>“It’ll look better yet when it’s all engraved,”
observed Randy. “I wonder where they will put
the name and the date? On this side, I suppose,”
and he turned the vase around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“Look out there! Watch where you’re going!”
came in a yell from Pud Hicks.</p>

<p>The cry was so sharp and unexpected that all
of the cadets started in alarm. As they glanced
up they saw a steam yacht bearing almost directly
across their bow.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re going to be hit, as sure as guns!”
exclaimed Spouter Powell.</p>

<p>“Back her, Pud! Back her!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p>“Sheer off! Sheer off to the right!” came
from Gif.</p>

<p>Badly frightened by the proximity of the steam
yacht which had come up without warning, Pud
Hicks stopped his motor and then threw over
his steering wheel in a wild endeavor to sheer
to starboard. But the steam yacht was too close.
There came frantic cries to “look out!” from the
craft, a blast of a steam whistle and the jangling
of a bell, and then motor boat and steam yacht
slid up to each other sideways.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked as if the motor boat
must be capsized. The craft careened at a sharp
angle, shipping not a little water. The shock was
greatest at the bow, and in a twinkling Phil Franklin
shot overboard. Andy and Randy Rover followed,
carrying the silver trophy with them.</p>

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sheer off! Sheer off!”</p>

<p>“You’ll send us to the bottom!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you look where you’re running?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t our fault! You changed your
course!” came from the steam yacht.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort! I was runnin’ as
straight as an arrow!” yelled Pud Hicks, in reply.</p>

<p>Then the two boats sheered away from each
other and presently both came to a standstill in
order that the occupants might ascertain what
damage had been done. In the meantime Phil
Franklin, who had disappeared beneath the surface
of the lake, reappeared and struck out lustily
for the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Where are Andy and Randy?” gasped Fred,
who had kept himself from being hurled overboard
by a firm hold on the rear gunwale.</p>

<p>“Ouch! My fingers!” came in a wild yell
from Spouter Powell. He had had the digits of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
his left hand severely pinched when the two craft
came together.</p>

<p>“The trophy went overboard!” groaned one
of the other cadets. “Andy and Randy took the
silver vase with them!”</p>

<p>“Never mind the trophy!” interrupted Jack
quickly. “If only they are not hurt!” he added
fervidly.</p>

<p>The youthful major had scarcely spoken when
a head bobbed up on the surface of the lake about
fifty feet away. It was Andy Rover, and he
struck out somewhat feebly for the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Andy! Andy! Are you all right?” yelled
Jack.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so!” gasped his cousin.</p>

<p>“Where is your brother?” screamed Fred. He
was in mortal terror, fearing Randy had been
seriously hurt and gone to the bottom.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely off his lips when
the waters of the lake parted once more and
Randy Rover reappeared. He threw up a hand
feebly.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” he gasped out. “Somebody
help me!”</p>

<p>“He’s got a cramp, or something!” exclaimed
Jack. “I’m going after him. Bring the boat
over,” and without further ado he balanced himself
on a seat of the motor boat and then dove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
overboard in the direction where his cousin had
appeared. Randy’s head and hand had gone
down slowly, and now he was once more out of
sight.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, the young major was
an excellent swimmer and he struck out with
vigor for the spot where his cousin had disappeared.</p>

<p>In less than a minute after Jack left the boat
Andy managed to reach the craft and was pulled
on board by Fred and Gif. Then the motor boat
was turned in the direction where Jack was
swimming.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Pud. We don’t want to hit anybody,”
cautioned Fred. And then he and some
others helped Phil Franklin to clamber aboard.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” answered the man at the
wheel. “Confound those fellers on that steam
yacht! They’re to blame!”</p>

<p>“It’s a steam yacht from up the lake—<i>Jocelyn</i>,”
said a cadet. “It belongs to the crowd that hangs
around the Outlook Hotel.”</p>

<p>A minute of vigorous swimming brought Jack
to the place where he had seen Randy go down.
Filling his lungs with air, he dove beneath the
surface, keeping his eyes wide open for whatever
might appear.</p>

<p>He saw his cousin a few yards away, struggling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
feebly to regain the surface. In another
moment he was at Randy’s side and then both
came up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, I’m so glad you came after me!”
were Randy’s first words, coming with severe
gasps. “I was afraid I was a goner.”</p>

<p>“What was the matter, Randy, that you
couldn’t swim better? Were you struck or was
it a cramp?”</p>

<p>“Neither. It was the silver trophy. I tried
to save it, but it was too heavy for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee, I forgot all about it!” answered
Jack. “Then the trophy has gone to the bottom
of the lake! But never mind—I’d rather have
the trophy missing than you,” he added grimly,
and then aided his cousin to keep afloat until the
motor boat came alongside and they were both
assisted on board.</p>

<p>And now I think it is high time that I pause
for a moment to introduce the Rover boys and
their friends to those who are meeting them for
the first time. In the first volume of this line
of books, entitled “The Rover Boys at School,”
I introduced three brothers, Dick, Tom and Sam
Rover, and related how they were sent to Putnam
Hall Military Academy where they made a
number of chums, including a cadet named
Lawrence Colby. From Putnam Hall the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Rover boys went to Brill College and then entered
business in Wall Street, New York City.</p>

<p>During their days at school the Rover brothers
fell in love with three nice girls, Dora Stanhope
and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. The
three young couples became married and settled
down in connecting houses on Riverside Drive in
New York City. As the result of his marriage
Dick Rover became the father of a son, Jack,
and a daughter named Martha; Sam Rover was
blessed with a girl named Mary, and then a son,
who was christened Fred. About this same time
Tom Rover’s wife, Nellie, came forward with a
lively pair of twin boys, who were named Anderson
and Randolph after their grandfather and
their great-uncle. Andy and Randy, as they were
always called, were full of fun, thus following
in the footsteps of their ever-lively father.</p>

<p>Residing side by side, the younger generation
of Rover boys, as well as the girls, were brought
up very much as one large family. At first they
attended private institutions of learning in the
metropolis. But presently, when the lads began
to develop a propensity for fun, it was decided
to send them to some stricter institution of
learning.</p>

<p>At that time Larry Colby was at the head of
a military academy called Colby Hall. Jack and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Fred, as well as the lively twins, were sent to
that institution of learning, and what happened to
them during their first term there has already
been related in a volume entitled “The Rover
Boys at Colby Hall.”</p>

<p>At school and elsewhere the young Rovers
made many friends, and also a few enemies.
Among their warmest chums were Gif Garrison,
the son of their fathers’ old friend, Fred Garrison,
after whom Fred Rover was named, and
Spouter Powell, the son of the older Rover boys’
chum, John Powell, always known as Songbird.</p>

<p>A term at Colby Hall had been followed by
some stirring winter adventures on “Snowshoe
Island.” Then the cadets returned to school to
go into an encampment “Under Canvas.” Later
still the lads went on a great “Hunt.” During
these times Jack and Fred took a great interest
in military matters, and the former gradually
worked up until he became major of the school
battalion while Fred became captain of Company
C. This was at a time when the World War
was taking place and when their fathers, and
also Colonel Colby, were doing their duty on the
battlefields of France.</p>

<p>The war at an end, the older Rovers returned
to the United States. Through a soldier whose
life he had saved Dick Rover became interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
in the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma, and
how he journeyed to the oil fields, taking the four
Rover boys with him, is fully set forth in a volume
entitled “The Rover Boys in the Land of
Luck.” Dick Rover, aided by the boys, was
highly successful in his quest for oil, but he made
several bitter enemies, including Carson Davenport,
who, with two of his pals, was sent to
prison.</p>

<p>From the oil fields the boys returned to school,
but a short time later accompanied Spouter Powell
on a trip to “Big Horn Ranch.” Later still they
went with Gif Garrison to “Big Bear Lake,”
where they had some great doings. It was here
that they found some of the Longley Academy
boys in camp and where Tommy Flanders, the
pitcher for the rival academy, had sought to do
them much harm and had been brought to book.</p>

<p>Colby Hall was located on Clearwater Lake not
far from the town of Haven Point. On the other
side of the town was situated Clearwater Hall,
a school for girls. Among the pupils at this institution
were Ruth Stevenson and also May
Powell, a cousin of Spouter Powell. Jack and
the other lads speedily became acquainted with
these girls and later on induced the folks at home
to allow Martha and Mary to become pupils at
the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Before Jack Rover had been elected major of
the school battalion, Ralph Mason had occupied
that important position. Through Ralph the lads
obtained an invitation for a motor boat trip out
to Nantucket and Cape Cod. What this trip led
to has already been related in the volume preceding
this, entitled “The Rover Boys Shipwrecked.”
They found themselves carried down
to the West Indies and were there plunged into
an unexpected hunt for pirates’ gold.</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly had great times on that
trip,” declared Randy. “I don’t suppose we’ll
ever have such strenuous times again.” But
Randy could not look into the future. Strenuous
days were still to come for the boys, as the pages
which follow will prove.</p>

<p>“Do you feel all right, Randy?” questioned
Fred anxiously, as his cousin came aboard, followed
by Jack.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’m all right!” gasped Randy.
“Gee, it’s too bad the silver trophy went to the
bottom of the lake! I hung on to it as long as
I could, but it was too much for me.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have risked your life for it,”
said Phil Franklin.</p>

<p>“I had hold of it, too, but I let go before Randy
did,” put in Andy. “I wasn’t going to drown
for any trophy, no matter how valuable it was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all the fault of that steam yacht,” growled
Pud Hicks. “We’re lucky they didn’t cut us in
two.”</p>

<p>“Run up alongside and see what they’ve got to
say,” said Jack, and as he spoke the young major
of the school battalion did what he could to
wring the water from his baseball uniform. Fortunately,
it being a warm day, there was little
danger of those who had been submerged taking
cold.</p>

<p>The steam yacht was crowded with men and
boys, most of whom had attended the ball game.</p>

<p>“You can’t lay this accident on me,” growled
the man in charge of the steam yacht, a burly
fellow with reddish hair and a bristly mustache.
“I blew my whistle and I had the right of way.”</p>

<p>“No such thing!” retorted Pud Hicks. “You
ran into us on purpose. I’m goin’ to report you.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was too bad it happened,” said
a young man on the steam yacht, as he eyed the
cadets critically. “You fellows didn’t get hurt,
did you?”</p>

<p>“I came pretty close to getting drowned,”
growled Randy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the silver trophy we just won was
knocked overboard,” added his brother. “I guess
the owner of the yacht will have to settle that
bill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“We won’t settle anything! It was all your
fault, and you know it!” said the man who was
running the steam yacht. “If any one is to make
a complaint, it ought to be me!”</p>

<p>After this there was a wordy war lasting for
five minutes or more. Each side seemed to be
convinced that the fault lay with the other crowd.
Finally a number of men aboard the steam yacht
began to grumble.</p>

<p>“Stop chewing the rag and take us up to the
hotel,” said one man. “I’ve got to catch that
evening train.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” put in another. “You fellows
can settle this some other time.” And a
minute later the steam yacht continued on its
way up Clearwater Lake.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t make much out of that,” remarked
one of the cadets.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I hold that they are responsible,”
said Pud Hicks sturdily.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” answered Jack. “But
whether you can hold them for it or not is a
question. If you took it to court probably they
would have as many witnesses to side with them
as we’d have for us.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care so much if only the silver
vase hadn’t been lost,” sighed Randy, who was
now feeling once more like himself. “Gee! what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
are we going to tell the other fellows and Colonel
Colby when we get back to the school?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’ll be an awful howl go up
when the fellows learn that the trophy has been
lost,” answered the young major soberly.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we fish it up?” questioned Fred
quickly. “How deep do you suppose the water
is around here?”</p>

<p>“Thirty or forty feet at least—maybe twice
that,” answered Pud Hicks.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to get it back somehow!”
cried Gif. “We worked too hard to win it to
lose it this way.”</p>

<p>The motor boat was run around in a circle in
the vicinity of the spot where the precious silver
trophy had disappeared beneath the waters of the
lake. Then, with heavy hearts, Pud Hicks and
the cadets turned once more in the direction of
the Colby Hall boat-landing.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED EXPLOSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the conquering heroes!”</p>

<p>“The fellows who snowed Longley under!”</p>

<p>“Let’s form a parade and march around the
campus with the silver trophy!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that was sure something worth
while!”</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries that rang out as
the motor boat containing the Rover boys and
their friends approached the Colby Hall boat-landing.</p>

<p>“Gee! how are we ever going to face that
bunch?” murmured Andy, and for once his face
grew pale.</p>

<p>“I almost feel like hiding,” came from his twin,
and it must be confessed that Randy looked thoroughly
miserable.</p>

<p>A number of motor boats had already landed
their occupants, but, strange as it may seem, none
of these cadets had seen the collision between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Pud Hicks’ craft and the <i>Jocelyn</i>, due, no doubt,
to the fact of there being so many boats making
it necessary for every one in command to pay
strict attention to how he was fashioning his
course across the lake.</p>

<p>“Hello! Why, you’re dripping wet!” exclaimed
Fatty Hendry, the stoutest lad in the
school, as Jack, the first to land, leaped on the
dock. “Whatever happened? Did you fall overboard?”</p>

<p>“We had an accident,” answered the young
major.</p>

<p>“Hello, Andy and Randy are wet, and so is Phil
Franklin!” put in Dan Soppinger, another of the
chums.</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?” questioned Ned Lowe, a
cadet who was quite a singer and who generally
led the cadets in their school songs.</p>

<p>“I had my fingers pinched, but it didn’t amount
to much,” answered Spouter Powell. “But something
pretty bad happened,” he went on.</p>

<p>“What was it?” questioned a dozen cadets at
once, and then several added quickly: “Where
is the silver trophy? Weren’t you to bring it
over?”</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence that was
intense. Nobody seemed to be willing to break
the bad news. Even Pud Hicks bent his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
away and pretended to be at work over the engine
of the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well tell the truth,” announced
Gif at last. “The silver trophy is at the
bottom of the lake.”</p>

<p>“At the bottom of the lake!”</p>

<p>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you fish it up again?”</p>

<p>Thereupon there was wild excitement, and the
cadets began to crowd closer to those who were
just landing. The boys kept coming up until at
least fifty of the Colby Hall pupils were assembled.
Then, seeing the unusual crowd, Captain
Mapes Dale, the chief military instructor of the
institution, strode forward hastily.</p>

<p>“A steam yacht ran into us and nearly bowled
us over,” said Randy.</p>

<p>Then all the boys who had come across the
lake with Pud Hicks tried to explain at once.
Numerous questions were asked and answered
and a dozen lads became wildly excited.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you have the owner of the
<i>Jocelyn</i> arrested?” questioned Walt Baxter.</p>

<p>“He ought to have been tarred and feathered,”
came from Bart White.</p>

<p>“Gosh! I’ll bet you fellows will catch it for
losing that trophy,” came from a thin boy who
had weak, shifty eyes and an unusually broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
mouth. His name was Henry Stowell and he
was generally known as the sneak of the school.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t our fault, Codfish,” answered Fred,
calling the sneak by the nickname which was
often applied to him. “The other boat headed
directly for us. If Pud Hicks hadn’t acted
quickly our boat might have been cut in two and
some of us might have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Humph! that’s easy enough for you to say,”
sneered Stowell. “If you could save yourselves,
as you did, I don’t see why you couldn’t save
the vase.”</p>

<p>This was a mean remark to make, since the
sneak did not know the details of the affair.
But his snap judgment was taken up by not a
few of the other cadets and they looked rather
sourly at the Rover boys and those who had
been with them in the ill-fated trip across the
lake.</p>

<p>“So you won the trophy only to lose it, eh?”
came from Captain Dale in a voice that showed
his regret. He had sense enough to know that
no lads would have worked so hard to win a prize
unless they were willing to do almost anything
to keep it. “Are you quite sure the collision was
not your fault, Hicks?” he demanded of the
school employee. Hicks was really the janitor’s
assistant, but had spent several years on the lake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and was known to be a careful man among both
sailboats and motor boats.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault at all, Captain Dale,” was
Hicks’ firm reply, and he went into the details,
as he knew them, of the happening.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to look into this and without delay,”
said the military instructor. “You had
better report to Colonel Colby.”</p>

<p>After that the Rovers and their chums hurried
to the gymnasium, and there those who were wet,
as well as the others, changed from their baseball
outfits into their uniforms. By this time it was
close to the supper hour, and Jack and Fred had
to hurry off to take charge of their commands.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Andy and Randy
felt in anything but an enviable frame of mind
when they went for their rifles and joined in the
brief parade around the campus which always preceded
the entrance to the mess hall.</p>

<p>“Some of the fellows will never forgive us for
losing that trophy,” remarked Andy, and his
usually smiling face showed nothing but gloom.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” answered his twin. “No
matter how we try to explain it, they’ll always
think that somehow or other we ought to have
hung on to the trophy when the collision came.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, Randy, you nearly lost your life
trying to save it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“There will be some of the fellows who’ll
never believe that—Codfish, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t pay any attention to that
sneak.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a bunch of others besides Codfish.
I heard Walt Baxter talking to Ned Lowe
just a few minutes ago; and while they didn’t
say it in so many words, it was easy to see that
they rather thought we should have made more
of an effort to save the trophy.”</p>

<p>“If only we can fish it up again!”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly going to have a try at it, and
that very soon. More than that, what’s the matter
with offering a reward for its recovery?”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk! We’ll do it!”</p>

<p>Here the conversation had to come to an end
as the boys took their places in the company’s
ranks.</p>

<p>“Battalion attention!” came a minute later
from Major Jack Rover, and every cadet straightened
up, with eyes front and rifle at his side.
A moment later the order came to march, the
drums and fifes struck up, and away went the
three companies of the school battalion around
the campus and then around the school buildings.
A few minutes later the cadets filed inside, placed
away their rifles and side arms, and crowded
rather noisily into the big mess hall, there to distribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
themselves at the various long tables presided
over by the teachers.</p>

<p>Discipline was rather strict this term, so that
conversation flagged during the time set apart
for eating. Yet the Rover boys could well understand
that nearly everything that was said
in an undertone related to the loss of the silver
trophy.</p>

<p>“It will certainly put a damper on the celebration
to-night,” whispered Fred to Gif, who sat
beside him.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t have to take it as seriously as
all that, Fred,” answered the manager of the baseball
team. “We won the championship, and that’s
the main thing, after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can’t send that to the bottom of the
lake,” returned the youngest Rover boy, with a
slight grin.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a possible victory, a number
of the cadets had been gathering boxes and barrels
with which to build bonfires, and as soon as it
grew dark enough these bonfires were started
along the lake front, being placed there so that
the Longley boys might see how their successful
rivals were celebrating the victory.</p>

<p>“The baseball nine to the front!” shouted
Fatty Hendry, who on account of his weight
never played ball but was one of the best rooters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the team possessed. “Come on! Get your bats
and join the parade!”</p>

<p>Andy and Randy felt like declining this invitation;
but Fatty and a number of others would
not listen to it and shoved them forward, and
in a very few minutes those who belonged to
the baseball team found themselves bats in hand
and surrounded by the other cadets, some with
drums and fifes and others with horns, rattles,
pans, and anything else that might be utilized
in making a noise. At the head of the procession
marched three of the tallest cadets, each carrying
a new broom borrowed for the occasion from
Mrs. Crews, the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Up and down the lake front went the cadets,
singing one school song after another always ending
with the well-known Hall refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who are we?</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Can’t you see?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Colby Hall!</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Dum, dum! dum, dum, dum!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Here we come with fife and drum!</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Colby, Colby, Colby Hall!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Give it to ’em louder!”
shouted Fatty Hendry, dancing wildly in front
of the singers and brandishing a stick. “Sing
it so loud that they can hear it clear across the
lake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Andy, we almost forgot!” cried his twin
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Forgot what?” put in Fred, who was marching
alongside his cousins.</p>

<p>“The cannon! We forgot the cannon,” answered
Randy.</p>

<p>“Say, did you fellows fix the cannon after
all?” questioned Fred quickly.</p>

<p>“We sure did! Come ahead, Fred. Now is
our chance to make a little noise in the world.”</p>

<p>“Say, don’t you know that that cannon hasn’t
been shot off in years?” demanded the young
captain of Company C. “It was only planted
along the lake front as an ornament.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we didn’t put in much of a charge,”
answered Andy. “It will make more of a sky-rocket
effect than anything else. We’ll elevate
it high into the air and have a barrel of fun when
it goes off.”</p>

<p>The field piece to which the lads referred was
one Colonel Colby had obtained from the Government
after the close of the World War. It
had been captured on the battlefront in France
and the owner of Colby Hall was proud to have
the piece planted at the corner of the school
campus overlooking the lake. At first the cadets
had been curious concerning this piece of artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
but soon their interest flagged and few paid
any attention to it. Then the idea entered Andy’s
head to place a charge in the old piece and in case
of a victory over Longley to discharge the same
during the evening’s celebration. Fred and Jack
had been called in consultation, but both had said
that it would not be altogether safe to do this.
Nevertheless, the twins had gone ahead and placed
the charge in the piece when they thought nobody
was looking.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be careful, Andy, when we fire
it,” cautioned his twin. “We can’t take too many
chances on such a gun as that. It may have
needed cleaning out when it was brought over
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will be all right,” was the ready reply.
“There isn’t any ball or shot in it, or anything
like that—it’s only a blank charge, one of those
left over down in the powder house. Besides
that, I’ve got a pretty long fuse, so we’ll not
have to stand anywhere near the thing when it
goes off.”</p>

<p>Making their way out of the crowd, the three
Rover boys stole in the direction of the cannon.
No one was near the piece, although they noticed
that one of the other cadets was following
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“Confound it, it’s Codfish! He’s always
sneaking around to try to get something on us,”
murmured Randy.</p>

<p>“Hi, Codfish! where are you going?” called
out Fred sharply.</p>

<p>“None of your business,” retorted the sneak
of the school, and then slunk back behind some
bushes.</p>

<p>With only the fitful glare from the bonfires
to light the way the three Rover boys advanced
to the cannon and gave it a hasty inspection.</p>

<p>“Let’s try to elevate it a little,” suggested
Randy. “Then the charge will make more of a
showing.”</p>

<p>Not without considerable effort, the boys managed
to raise the muzzle of the field piece until
it was elevated to an angle of about forty-five
degrees. Then Andy brought forth his fuse and
attached the same.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” cried the fun-loving Rover,
and without hesitation struck a match and applied
the light to the fuse. Instantly the latter
began to fizz, and all of the boys took to their
heels.</p>

<p>Bang! <a href="#i_fp034">It was a tremendous explosion</a>, much
louder than any of the boys had anticipated, and
it fairly made the windows of the various school
buildings rattle. Looking, they saw not one spurt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of flames, but a dozen or more shooting in
various directions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp034">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_32">IT WAS A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“It’s busted! The cannon has busted!” gasped
Fred, who had been thrown off his feet by the
concussion.</p>

<p>“Gee! it can’t have been much of a piece,” was
Andy’s comment, and he looked startled.</p>

<p>The tremendous report which echoed and re-echoed
against the buildings and the hills beyond
was followed by a moment of silence. Then
came a yell from the cadets at the other end of
the lake shore.</p>

<p>“I’m hit! I’m shot in the arm!”</p>

<p>“Something struck me in the back!”</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I’m killed! Somebody shot
me!”</p>

<p>So the cries ran on while the three Rover boys
gazed at each other in abject consternation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE ACCUSATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Somebody’s shot!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“They must have been hit by some pieces of
the cannon!” gasped out Randy. “I felt something
whizz by my ear when it went off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, something whistled close to me, too,”
answered his twin. “Gee! I hope no one is seriously
hurt.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so at such a distance,”
said Fred. For the nearest group of cadets in
the celebration was more than a hundred yards
away, for the captured cannon had been placed
on the boundary line of the campus.</p>

<p>Already a number of cadets and teachers were
hurrying in the direction where the cannon had
been located. The piece itself had blown in various
directions, only a portion of the base remaining.</p>

<p>“Halt! What is the meaning of this?” came
in ringing tones from Captain Dale, as the military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
instructor ran swiftly in the direction of the
explosion.</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain Dale, we didn’t mean to smash
the cannon!” cried Randy quickly. For a brief
instant he, as well as the others, had contemplated
running away, then had tacitly decided to
face the consequences of their ill-advised attempt
at fun.</p>

<p>“Did you discharge that cannon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But we had no idea that it was
going to explode,” answered Andy. “We didn’t
put anything into it but a small blank charge—not
enough to bust up a one-pounder.”</p>

<p>“Was any one seriously hurt?” questioned Fred
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Colonel Colby and Professor
Grawson are investigating. The colonel sent me
up here to question those responsible for the
affair. You admit that you did it, do you, Captain
Rover?” he added sternly.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Fred’s fault!” burst out Andy
quickly. “I—and my brother—put the charge
in the piece and set it off. But really and truly,
Captain Dale, we didn’t expect it to do more than
make a very small report. All we placed in the
cannon was one of those blank charges from the
powder house—one of those old ones marked
‘BB 27.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“What did you put on top of the blank charge?”
demanded the military instructor. “Rammed the
cannon full of stones, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We didn’t put in anything but a
couple of loose newspapers. We thought the
papers would scatter over the campus and make
some fun.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you didn’t put in any stones?”
and the military instructor turned to Randy.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the newspapers, Captain. I am
positive of it.”</p>

<p>“In that case how do you account for the
cannon exploding? It undoubtedly needed cleaning,
but it was too heavy a piece to blow up with
nothing more in it than a blank BB 27 charge.
Well, the three of you go to the office and report
to Colonel Colby when he comes in,” ordered
Captain Dale. “We’ll have a thorough investigation
of this as soon as the excitement is over
and we have found out how badly those cadets
are injured.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go and see if Jack is all right first?”
questioned Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may do that. But don’t waste any
time. I ought to place you under arrest, but if
what you say is true about using only a small
blank charge, evidently you meant it only in fun
to help along the celebration. Of course, you had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
no right to take anything out of the powder house.
But that point can be settled later.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the excitement among the
cadets was gradually calming down. It was found
that Ned Lowe had been struck in the shoulder
and a cadet named Grimshaw had been hit in the
back, while several others had received minor
injuries. Both Lowe and Grimshaw were severely
bruised and were sent to the school, there to be
placed under the matron’s care until a doctor could
be summoned.</p>

<p>“Jack! are you all right?” questioned Fred, as
he ran up to his cousin, followed by the twins.</p>

<p>“All right, except that a stone or something
flew right past my face,” was the reply. “Who
shot off that cannon?”</p>

<p>“We did,” answered Andy, indicating himself
and his brother. “But we didn’t know the confounded
thing was going to bust,” and thereupon
the twins made a complete confession, Jack, Gif,
Spouter, and a number of others listening with
interest. Then the three Rover boys went to the
office as ordered.</p>

<p>Flashlights and lanterns were brought into
play, and it was soon ascertained that none of
the broken parts of the cannon had come near
where the cadets had been celebrating. Pieces
of cannon had struck behind the gymnasium and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
along the lake front, and other pieces had probably
gone into the water.</p>

<p>“It’s stones that did the damage—stones, and
nothing else!” exclaimed Gif. “Look here!” and
he pointed at a box standing near one of the
bonfires. The box had been peppered with both
large and small stones, some of the smaller ones
being still embedded in the wood.</p>

<p>“But Andy and Randy said they placed nothing
on top of the blank charge but a couple of
loose newspapers,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“It was undoubtedly stones that did the damage
here,” came from Professor Grawson.</p>

<p>“The boys who did this should be dismissed
from the school,” thundered Professor Snopper
Duke, a dictatorial teacher whom many of the
cadets detested.</p>

<p>“Well, it was probably done in fun with no
intention of harm,” returned Professor Grawson,
who generally took the side of the boys.</p>

<p>While Fred and the twins were passing an
uncomfortable time outside Colonel Colby’s office
waiting for the commandant’s appearance, Dan
Soppinger and Fatty Hendry came up.</p>

<p>“Say, what did you want to load that cannon
with rocks for?” demanded Hendry. “Did you
want to shoot somebody’s head off?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t put any rocks in,” retorted Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you did. Pieces of stone are sticking
in all sorts of places; the cannon must have
been loaded to the muzzle.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly filled with stones, Andy,”
said Dan. “The fellows who were hurt were hit
by stones and not by pieces of the cannon.”</p>

<p>“Then somebody fixed that cannon after we
placed the charge in it!” exclaimed Randy.
“Now, who could have done that?”</p>

<p>“Jimminy beeswax, I’ve got it!” ejaculated his
twin. “Codfish! That’s what he was sneaking
around for!”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right!” put in Fred. “He’s
just the sneak to play a mean trick like that.
He knew you were going to fire the cannon and
he filled it with stones just to make trouble for
you.”</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s go after him before Colonel
Colby comes!” cried Randy. “I’ll get the truth
out of that sneak if I have to hammer the daylights
out of him.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to locate Henry Stowell.
He was not on the campus nor in the gymnasium.
Nor was he to be found in the room he and
another cadet occupied.</p>

<p>“That proves he’s guilty,” was Andy’s comment.
“He wouldn’t hide like this if he didn’t
have something to be afraid of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>In one of the corridors they met several of
the cadets, and one of these stated that he had
seen Stowell walking toward the Hall garage.
At once the twins and Fred started in that direction.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Codfish is going to keep out of sight
until it’s time to turn in,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“He isn’t going to keep out of sight—not if
I can help it,” returned Andy.</p>

<p>“Let’s separate and each make a hunt on his
own account,” suggested Randy. “If any one
locates him whistle three times.” So it was arranged,
and the three Rovers began a systematic
search, first of the garage and then of the large
barns attached to the Hall.</p>

<p>At first their hunt was unsuccessful. Nobody
was in or near the garage and the horses seemed
to have the barn to themselves. But then Fred
came upon a toolhouse and, throwing open the
door, saw a dim form inside.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he called out. “Come out of
that!”</p>

<p>For a moment there was no reply, and then a
pretended sleepy voice asked:</p>

<p>“What do you want? Why can’t you let a
fellow sleep? I’m all tired out.”</p>

<p>“Come out of that, Codfish!” ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
young captain of Company C, and thereupon he
whistled three times as loudly as he could.</p>

<p>“I haven’t done anything! You let me alone!”
whined the sneak of the school.</p>

<p>“Come out!” ordered Fred again, and as Codfish
emerged from the toolhouse he caught the
cadet by the arm.</p>

<p>“You let me alone, Fred Rover! Let me alone,
I tell you, or I’ll report you to Colonel Colby.”</p>

<p>“If there is any reporting to do, I’ll do it,”
answered the young captain. “Now come along,
and don’t try to run away.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to take me? I wasn’t
doing any harm. I got sleepy and thought I’d
take a nap, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Codfish, if I wasn’t mad at you, I’d have to
laugh,” answered Fred. “Of course you’d rather
sleep on a wooden box in the toolhouse than on
your own soft bed upstairs, wouldn’t you?” he
added sarcastically.</p>

<p>By this time Andy came running up, presently
followed by his twin. As the three Rover boys
surrounded him, Henry Stowell became more disturbed
than ever.</p>

<p>“You let me alone!” he howled. “Don’t you
dare touch me! I haven’t done anything!”</p>

<p>“Stowell, you stuffed that cannon with stones.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
You know you did!” cried Randy, catching the
sneak by the collar.</p>

<p>“I didn’t! I didn’t do anything!” howled
Codfish.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did! And you’ve got to admit it!”
stormed Andy, shaking his fist under the sneak’s
nose. “You tell the truth now or you’ll get the
worst licking you ever had in your life.”</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!” bellowed
Codfish, now shaking from head to foot. “Let
me alone! Help! Help!” he added feebly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” And now Randy clapped his hand
over the sneak’s mouth. “You yell again and
you’ll get something you won’t want. Now then,
out with it! Why did you put the stones in the
cannon?”</p>

<p>“Now—now—I—er—didn’t mean any harm,”
spluttered Codfish. “I—er—only did it in fun.
I didn’t know the cannon would explode.”</p>

<p>“You come along to Colonel Colby’s office and
tell your story there,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, please, Captain Rover, don’t make
me go to Colonel Colby’s office!” whined the
sneak. “If he hears of this maybe he’ll send me
home and then my father will knock the daylights
out of me!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going to the office just the same,”
declared Fred. “My cousins here aren’t going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
have this happening placed to their discredit.
They’re in bad enough as it is—we all are,” he
added.</p>

<p>Much against his will and still protesting
loudly, Stowell was marched back to the Hall
and to the office, where Colonel Colby had just
arrived, followed by Captain Dale and Professor
Grawson. Captain Dale had already reported to
the master of the Hall, and Colonel Colby looked
at the three Rovers in a troubled way.</p>

<p>“This is rather a serious piece of fun, Captain
Rover,” he said, addressing Fred. “I am sorry
to see you and your cousins mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>“He had nothing to do with it, Colonel Colby,”
put in Randy. “I and my brother are guilty so
far as placing a blank charge in the cannon and
setting it off. But we didn’t place in it the
stones that did all the damage,” he added.</p>

<p>“Who did that?” demanded Colonel Colby.</p>

<p>To this none of the Rover boys replied, but all
looked suggestively at Codfish.</p>

<p>“Oh, Colonel Colby, please, please forgive me!”
sobbed the sneak, breaking down and hiding his
face in his hands. “I didn’t mean to do any harm—really
I didn’t! I thought it would be nothing
but a joke!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<small>THE MAN ON THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, I reckon you fellows can be thankful
you got out of it so easily.”</p>

<p>It was Jack who spoke, addressing his three
cousins. It was an hour after the session in
Colonel Colby’s office, and the cadets had brought
their celebration to an end and were preparing
to retire.</p>

<p>Henry Stowell’s confession had come somewhat
as a surprise to the owner of the Hall.
The sneak had been so wrought up and so fearful
of consequences that in the end he had been
placed in charge of Professor Grawson, who did
what he could to calm the youth.</p>

<p>A doctor had made a careful inspection of the
wounds caused by the flying stones and had reported
that none of the hurts was serious and
that the injured cadets would be as well as ever
in a few days. This being so, the colonel had
come to the conclusion to let the matter rest as
it stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“Of course the boys should not have discharged
the cannon,” he said to Captain Dale. “But,
after all, it was only a schoolboy trick.” He
had not forgotten that he had once been a boy
himself, and that when a pupil at Putnam Hall
with Dick, Tom and Sam Rover he had played
many a trick himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll say the colonel is a brick!” declared Andy,
with satisfaction. “A real, genuine, dyed-in-the-wool
brick!”</p>

<p>“He’s all wool and a yard wide,” added Randy.
“The best ever!”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad the cannon had to go up,” said
Fred. “I rather think the colonel will hate to lose
that piece.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about that,” said Randy. He
turned to the young major. “Do you think, Jack,
that your dad could get the authorities at Washington
to let him have another cannon? They
must have a lot of those old pieces lying around
loose.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but we might find out,” was
Jack’s answer.</p>

<p>News of the explosion was carried to Clearwater
Hall, and the Rover girls and their friends
became much excited wondering if any of the
cadets had been seriously hurt.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t fire off any more cannons,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Martha, when she saw the boys. “It’s too risky
a thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Just as if soldiers don’t have to fire off cannons
right along!” ejaculated Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes! But not old pieces that are all rusty,”
put in Mary.</p>

<p>The explosion was a topic of interest at the
Hall for a number of days, and with this was
another topic of equal if not greater importance,
and that was, as may be imagined, the loss of the
silver trophy.</p>

<p>Early on the morning following the celebration
a number of the cadets went out on the lake and
dragged a part of the bottom in the hope of
bringing up the vase. This attempt proved of
no avail, and later attempts during the term were
equally unsuccessful. Colonel Colby had Captain
Dale and Professor Paul Brice call upon the
owner of the steam yacht and see what he had
to say concerning the matter.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all to blame—not in the least,” declared
the owner of the <i>Jocelyn</i>. “There are half
a dozen men at the Outlook Hotel who were on
board, and every one of them will testify to the
truth of what I am saying.”</p>

<p>“Well, our cadets are willing to testify that it
was your fault,” declared Captain Dale, with some
sharpness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“All right! If you think that way, go on and
take it to court,” said the owner; and there the
matter rested.</p>

<p>The one man who was thoroughly enraged
over the matter was Pud Hicks, and he did not
hesitate to declare himself.</p>

<p>“The feller who was steerin’ that steam yacht
is to blame, and he knows it,” growled the Hall
employee. “For two pins I’d go up to the Outlook
Hotel and knock the stuffin’ out of him.”</p>

<p>“That would do more harm than good, Pud,”
answered Gif. “He could have you arrested for
it and perhaps sent to jail for six months for
assault and battery.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a shame to let him get away with it,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“So it is,” answered the manager of the ball
team. “But I don’t see how it can be helped.
If Colonel Colby took it to court they would
have as many witnesses on their side as we should
have on ours, and the case would probably get
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“I believe some of the men on the yacht sympathized
with us,” remarked Jack. “One fellow,
a young man, looked that way, anyhow. But of
course you can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Colonel Colby will have somebody investigate,”
said Fred hopefully. “If he can get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the right witnesses he can put the screws on that
yacht owner.”</p>

<p>There were many of the cadets who did not
blame any of the baseball team for the mishap
which had deprived the school of the trophy.
There were, however, others, perhaps ten or a
dozen all told, who laid the blame entirely on
Andy and Randy.</p>

<p>“Those twins are forever cutting up,” growled
Grimshaw, the fellow who had been hit by one of
the stones from the cannon. “For all we know,
it might have been nothing but their horseplay
that sent the trophy to the bottom of the lake.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true, Grimshaw!” burst out Spouter
indignantly. “It was lost on account of the collision,
and in no other way!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, those Rover twins ought to
be more careful,” put in another cadet.</p>

<p>“That’s the truth!” added still another. “What
business had they to place the trophy on the forward
deck, anyhow? Why didn’t they leave it
in the bottom of the boat? Then it wouldn’t
have gone overboard even when the boat did
tip up.”</p>

<p>Some of this talk reached the ears of the Rover
boys and it made them all, and especially the
twins, feel very bad.</p>

<p>“Gee, I feel like taking some of that money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
I got from the pirates’ treasure and buying another
vase,” remarked Andy. “Only, it wouldn’t
be <em>the</em> vase.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay for a new one quick enough if they’ll
get it,” added his twin. The following day,
which was Saturday, the four Rover boys and
their chums spent the whole afternoon dragging
the lake bottom and in diving in a vain hunt for
the missing trophy.</p>

<p>With the baseball season at an end, the cadets
were forced to give all their attention to their
studies. Final examinations were now at hand
and those who expected to graduate had to turn
in compositions on the subjects assigned to
them.</p>

<p>“Gosh! but I’ll be glad when the examinations
are over,” remarked Fred, one evening after he
had been poring over his books for an hour or
more. “My head is fairly splitting with all the
stuff I’m expected to remember.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you think it’s a real picnic for
us fellows,” grinned Andy, and then, catching up
a sheet of waste paper, he made a small ball of
it which he threw at Jack, who was busy with
pencil and paper sketching out a composition he
had to turn in.</p>

<p>“Quit the horseplay,” came shortly from the
young major, and then, after biting the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
his pencil, he continued rather testily: “Hang it
all, Andy, I had a brilliant thought I was going
to put down and you knocked it clean out of my
head.”</p>

<p>“Sorry. What does a brilliant thought look
like? If it fell on the floor maybe I can find
it for you,” returned the fun-loving Rover, with
provoking calmness.</p>

<p>Thereupon Jack leaped up and rushed over,
only to find that Andy had slipped under the
table, coming up grinningly on the other side.
Then ensued a race around the room in which
the other two Rovers were jerked off their chairs.
A general scrimmage followed in which Andy
finally found himself on the floor with the other
three on top of him.</p>

<p>“Hi! Let up! What do you think you’re
holding down—the rock of Gibraltar?” gasped
Andy, trying his best to kick and punch at the
same time.</p>

<p>“Will you promise to keep quiet?” questioned
the young major, who sat on his stomach.</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll be good!” gasped the boy on the
floor. “Let up before you cave in all my ribs.”
Thereupon he was released and quietness was
once more restored so that the lads could continue
their studies.</p>

<p>“Wonder what we can do this summer?” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Fred on Sunday afternoon, after the boys, with
some other cadets, had attended church at Haven
Point. There they had met the girls from Clearwater
Hall and two of these, Alice Strobell and
Annie Larkins, had announced that they were
to take a trip to Europe with their parents.</p>

<p>“I think that’s going to depend on how we
make out with our examinations,” answered
Jack. “Anyway, when I broached the subject to
dad he said we had better put it off until after
graduation.”</p>

<p>“Gee, suppose we don’t graduate?” interposed
Randy.</p>

<p>“That’s just it! If we don’t, we don’t!” answered
Fred. “And that means if we don’t graduate
we don’t get any very remarkable vacation.
Perhaps they’ll send us up on the farm,
to take it easy with Aunt Martha and Uncle
Randolph.”</p>

<p>“Wow! Think of spending a whole summer
in that out-of-the-way place!” moaned Randy.</p>

<p>The Rover boys had separated from their
chums and were walking along a road which
ran some distance behind the school. They were
in no hurry to get back to the Hall, having half
an hour to spare before the mid-day meal. It
was unusually sultry, and now the boys heard
the distant rumble of thunder and noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
some heavy clouds were appearing on the horizon
to the westward.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a shower, and that very
soon,” announced Jack. “Better hit it up and
get to the school before we get wet.”</p>

<p>The boys were making rapid progress and had
almost reached a back road running to the outbuildings
of the school when the first drops of
rain commenced to come down. At the same
time they heard the toot of an automobile horn
and a roadster carrying two men came whirling
along the highway. The four Rovers stepped
aside to let the car pass. As it came closer the
roadster slowed up. Evidently the two men were
strangers to that locality for they looked around
as if trying to find some signboard.</p>

<p>“Is this the road to Haven Point?” called out
one of the men. As he did so the second man,
after a glance at the boys, suddenly turned his
face away from them.</p>

<p>“It is,” answered Fred. “Keep straight ahead
for about three-quarters of a mile.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this the driver of the car put
on speed and the roadster was soon lost in the
distance.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jack?” exclaimed Randy,
as the car passed from sight. “What are you
staring at?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“That fellow who was in the roadster! The
man who sat alongside the driver!” ejaculated the
young major. “Did you notice him?”</p>

<p>“I saw him give one look at us and then turn
away,” answered Andy. “Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Unless I was greatly mistaken, it was Carson
Davenport,” announced Jack, and his words filled
his cousins with astonishment.</p>

</div>


<p>“Carson Davenport!” exclaimed Fred.
“Why, Jack, you must be dreaming!”</p>

<p>“Carson Davenport is in jail. We saw him
arrested ourselves,” added Randy.</p>

<p>“And he couldn’t even get bail—dad said so,”
put in Andy.</p>

<p>“I don’t care, I’m almost certain that was
Carson Davenport in that car,” answered Jack
firmly.</p>

<p>As the readers of the volume entitled “The
Rover Boys in the Land of Luck” know, Carson
Davenport was the oil well promoter whom the
boys had met on the border between Texas and
Oklahoma. He was an unscrupulous individual
who had robbed Jack’s father of some papers supposed
to be of great value and later on had done
everything he could to harm all of the Rovers.
But one plot after another had been exposed, and
in the end Carson Davenport had been arrested
just at the time he was attempting to leave town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
with some money belonging to himself and to
four of his partners. Two of his partners, Tate
and Jackson, had stopped him, and a wordy quarrel
had brought on the arrest of the three men.
Each was tried for his wrongdoings and sentenced
to a term in prison.</p>

<p>“If Davenport is out of the pen, Phil Franklin
ought to know something about it,” said Fred.
For Phil and his father lived in the oil fields and
had had considerable dealings with the rascals
mentioned.</p>

<p>“If Davenport is around here we had better
keep our eyes open,” came from Randy. “I don’t
trust that chap any more than I’d trust a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“I guess none of us would,” returned Fred.
“Gee! how mad he was when he sunk that twenty
thousand dollars he and Tate and Jackson put
up, not to say anything about the small fortune
contributed by the Martells, the Browns and Mr.
Werner.”</p>

<p>As it was now raining harder, the boys hurried
to the Hall and then up to their rooms to get
ready for the mid-day meal. On Sunday all
military exercises were dispensed with. On the
stairs they met Phil Franklin and immediately
asked him if he had a few minutes to spare.</p>

<p>“Sure,” was Phil’s ready response. “Haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
got a thing to do until the bell rings for grub.”</p>

<p>“Come on to our rooms while we’re fixing up,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>Once in the rooms occupied by the Rovers, the
latter acquainted the boy from the oil fields with
what had taken place on the road.</p>

<p>“Davenport here? Oh, you must be mistaken!”
said Phil. “Why, he’s in prison down in Texas.
And so are Tate and Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard anything of their
being released?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. And I don’t think they have
been.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I was mistaken, but I don’t
think so,” and the young major shook his head
slowly.</p>

<p>Final examinations began on Monday, and the
boys were kept busy for several days. Then
came a respite of twenty-four hours, for which
the Rovers were thankful.</p>

<p>The mail came in at noon, and less than half
an hour later Phil Franklin burst in on the
Rover boys like a cyclone.</p>

<p>“Here’s news! Just the thing you wanted to
know!” he cried out, waving a newspaper clipping.
“My father sent it to me in a letter he
wrote. It tells all about Davenport, Tate, Jackson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and several other prisoners. They are all out
on parole.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” ejaculated Jack. “Let me see
the clipping, Phil.”</p>

<p>His cousins gathered close while Jack read the
newspaper clipping aloud. It had been cut from
an Oklahoma sheet and told how a number of
prisoners in one of the Texas prisons had been
placed on parole by the authorities.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I was right after all and that
was Davenport,” said the young major. “Now
the question is: What was he doing up here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll answer that by saying you can be sure
he was up to no good,” declared Fred.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right there,” answered Phil.
“I wouldn’t trust that rascal a bit further than I
could see him. If ever there was a snake in the
grass, it was Carson Davenport. Just see how
he and his cronies struck down Jack’s father in
the room at the hotel and robbed him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not forgetting it,” answered Jack.
“I think it’s an outrage that they let that rascal
off so easily.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the prisons are overcrowded and they
have to let some of the old prisoners out in order
to let the new ones in,” suggested Randy.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep our eyes open,” said Fred, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
after Phil Franklin had left he continued: “You
know what I think? I think we had better let
the girls know of this.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose Davenport would bother
Mary and Martha, do you?” asked Randy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he’d do. A rascal like
that is apt to do almost anything.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Davenport just came up this way on
business, or something like that,” suggested Andy
lightly. “He’s got to do something for a living,
you know. He sunk about all the money he could
rake and scrape up in those oil wells that went
dry.”</p>

<p>“I think Fred is right, and we had better let
the girls know,” decided Jack thoughtfully. “Of
course, we don’t want to alarm them too much;
but it’s better to warn them so they can keep
their eyes open if Davenport does show up.”</p>

<p>“We can’t telephone—it might scare ’em stiff,”
said Fred. “Let’s get permission to go over there
this evening. We can get Hicks to run us over
in a car.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and the boys spent half
an hour with the Rover girls and with Ruth
Stevenson and May Powell.</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of such a thing!” exclaimed
Martha. “Whatever do you suppose the man is
up to, Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“There is no telling. But we want you to be
careful when you go out. You don’t want to
fall in with such a bad egg as Davenport.”</p>

<p>“You boys had better be careful yourselves,”
broke in Mary. “I guess that man would rather
do something to you than to us. From all accounts,
he hates you and Uncle Dick like poison.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, do be careful!” said Ruth, when
the boys were ready to depart. “Why, for all
you know, that rascal might try to shoot you!”</p>

<p>“You be careful, too, Fred,” came from May
Powell. “Perhaps the fellow will try to rob
you, just to get square for what he lost in the
oil fields.”</p>

<p>The girls were also deep in their examinations,
and as they had still some writing and studying
to do the boys did not remain as long as they
might otherwise have done. Returning to Colby
Hall, they tried to dismiss Carson Davenport
from their minds and pitch into the work that
still remained to be done on their compositions.</p>

<p>So far Jack and Fred had done very well and
each felt certain that up to that point he had
scored at least ninety-five per cent. The twins
were not so fortunate, but as Andy expressed it,
“they hoped they hit the ninety mark, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Latin is what gets me,” groaned Andy.
“Whoever wanted to invent such a beastly language,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
anyway? Why couldn’t they talk United
States and be done with it?”</p>

<p>“It’s mathematics that’s my bugbear,” said his
twin. “The fellow who got up square root and
cube root in that science ought to be hung.”</p>

<p>“Just wait until I get through with these
books,” went on Andy. “If they won’t make the
most dandy bonfire you ever saw, then I’ll miss
my guess.”</p>

<p>The one humble boy around Colby Hall those
days was Henry Stowell. Following the incident
connected with the explosion of the cannon the
sneak had not appeared for several days in the
classrooms. When he did show up he had little
to say and he did his best to avoid the Rovers.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s learned one lesson, all right
enough,” was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“Gee, but putting those stones in the cannon
was a serious piece of business,” declared Fred.
“Why, some of the cadets might have been
killed!”</p>

<p>At the end of the week came a surprise for the
boys. Sam Rover had had to take a business
trip to a city not far from Haven Point, and
drove over in his automobile, first to call on the
girls and then to visit his son and his nephews.</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam!” cried Jack, who was the first
to greet him. “This sure is a surprise! I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
awfully glad to see you!” and he shook hands
warmly.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d drop in and see how you’re making
out with your final examinations,” said Sam
Rover. “Is everything going along all right?”</p>

<p>“We hope so,” answered the young major.
“Some of the questions are pretty stiff though,
I can tell you that!”</p>

<p>“Well, nothing that’s worth while in life is
very easy,” answered Fred’s father, and then the
others came up and there was a general rejoicing
all around. The boys took the older Rover into
the Hall, where he was greeted by his old chum,
Colonel Colby.</p>

<p>“It always seems like a touch of old times
when you or Dick or Tom come around,” said
Colonel Colby to Sam Rover, when they were
left alone for a few minutes. “It’s a pity we
can’t get together oftener.”</p>

<p>“How are the boys making out? I hope they’re
putting their minds down to their studies.”</p>

<p>“They’re doing very well, especially Fred and
Jack,” answered the master of the Hall. “It
seems to be a little more difficult for the twins.
They take so much after Tom,” and Colonel Colby
showed a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re chips of the old block—no question
about that,” answered Fred’s father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Colby was on the point of mentioning
the exploded cannon, but suddenly thought better
of it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the boys will have something to tell
you, Sam,” he said, on parting for the time being.
“If they haven’t, just ask me about it. I
want to give them a chance to speak first if they
care to do so.”</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant thing to broach, yet the
twins thought they must make a clean breast of
it, so when Sam Rover had accompanied the boys
to their rooms Andy and Randy spoke not only
about the exploded cannon, but also of the loss of
the silver trophy.</p>

<p>“Gracious! you lads are certainly getting into
hot water,” was Sam Rover’s comment. “To lose
the trophy was bad enough, but to have that
cannon explode——” He ended with a shake of
his head. “You’ve got to be more careful. It
won’t do to kill anybody.”</p>

<p>“We’d like to get another cannon for Colonel
Colby,” said Randy. “Do you suppose Uncle
Dick and you and dad could manage it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. We can see about that later. I’m
glad you told me about this.”</p>

<p>“Did Colonel Colby say anything about it?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t he all to the mustard!” exclaimed Andy.
“Gosh, Uncle Sam, he must have been a fine fellow
for a school chum!”</p>

<p>“He was, Andy—a real prince of good fellows.”
Sam Rover paused for a moment. “Now
then, I’ve got something to tell you,” he went
on. “I hope it won’t interfere with your examination
tests,” he added. “But it’s something that
must be told. I haven’t said anything to the girls
about it, but you boys had better know it.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” the lads questioned in concert.</p>

<p>“That rascal, Carson Davenport, is at liberty
along with his pals, Jackson and Tate.”</p>

<p>“We know that already.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so the girls told me this morning,” came
from Sam Rover. “But there is something more
to tell than that—something the girls know nothing
about.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Davenport paid a secret visit to your father
last week,” was the reply. “He demanded fifty
thousand dollars, and said if it wasn’t forthcoming
he would make the Rovers suffer as they
had never suffered before.”</p>

</div>


<p>“Davenport demanded fifty thousand dollars!”
ejaculated Randy.</p>

<p>“He certainly doesn’t want much, does he?”
was Fred’s comment.</p>

<p>“Of course my dad didn’t let him have a cent!”
came quickly from Jack.</p>

<p>“I knew you boys would be surprised,” said
Sam Rover, with something of a grim smile crossing
his face. “No, he didn’t give Davenport anything
but a piece of his mind and told the fellow
if he didn’t clear out at once he’d have him placed
under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Dad should have had him held, Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said, and so did your Uncle
Tom. But your father reasoned that he had had
enough trouble with Davenport, and the fellow
had had trouble too—losing his money in those
oil wells that went dry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the rascal is a thief and worse!” burst
out Fred. “Why, he even tried to rob his partners!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Did dad have any idea Davenport was coming
up here?” questioned the young major.</p>

<p>“He didn’t know what Davenport’s next move
would be, but he thought it would be a good idea
for me to warn both you and the girls.”</p>

<p>“Well, we were already on our guard, and now
that we know he has made this outrageous demand
for money we’ll be more wary than ever,”
said Randy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he doesn’t try to make trouble for
the girls!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“I have warned them to be very careful of
their movements while they remain at the school,”
answered Sam Rover. “We would prefer to
have them go home, but they wish to finish the
term.”</p>

<p>“They ought not to go out at all unless they
have a man or one of us with them,” remarked
Jack. “It wouldn’t be safe.”</p>

<p>“Wonder who the man was in the runabout
with Davenport?” came from Andy.</p>

<p>“He was a stranger to me,” replied his twin,
and the other boys said the same.</p>

<p>Sam Rover took his departure that evening and
on the following morning the boys went to their
classes for their final tests. Jack did not finish
until after three o’clock and his cousins were even
later in appearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, I don’t know whether I squeezed through
or not,” remarked Andy. “Some of the questions
were stiffer than I expected.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word! I know I flunked on two
or three questions,” answered his twin.</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t answer everything correctly,”
came from the young major.</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” added Fred.</p>

<p>One by one the cadets assembled on the campus
and along the lake front. A few went out to
row, but most of them hung around, wanting to
know how others had made out.</p>

<p>That day Phil Franklin received another letter
from his father in which his parent stated that
he intended to take a trip to the oil fields of
Oklahoma.</p>

<p>“And he wants me to remain here until the
school opens again this fall,” said Phil. “What
do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean at the Hall!” exclaimed Fred.
“Why, Colonel Colby just about shuts the place
up during July and August.”</p>

<p>“No, my father wants to know if I can’t find
some suitable boarding house at Haven Point,
or some other place in this vicinity. He thinks
I’d be better off here than down home during
his absence.”</p>

<p>“What about boarding with Barry Logan?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
suggested Randy, mentioning a boy of the town
whose mother kept a boarding house. The cadets
had often met young Logan on the lake where
he earned his living by fishing and by taking
people out in his boat.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking I might do,”
answered Phil. “I’ve met Barry’s mother, and
she is a real nice lady, and I could have dandy
times out on the lake with Barry.”</p>

<p>“If you stay here, Phil, I know what I’d like
you to do!” cried Randy.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to hire Barry to go on a hunt for
that silver trophy. He might get some kind of
a trawl and bring the vase up.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk! If I stay here I certainly will
go on a hunt for that trophy!” exclaimed Phil.
“It will help fill in the time.”</p>

<p>On the following Friday afternoon there was a
special session of the school, and the cadets were
acquainted with the results of the examinations.
It was found that Fred had received 96 per cent.,
Jack 94 per cent., Andy and Randy 89 and 88
per cent., respectively. Gif had 92 per cent. to
his credit, Phil 91 per cent., while Spouter was
overjoyed to learn that he had reached 98 per
cent., the highest record made that year.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, Spouter! You’re sure the king pin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
when it comes to studying!” cried Jack, and shook
hands warmly.</p>

<p>“Well, you and Fred did pretty well,” answered
Spouter modestly.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’m glad I passed!” murmured
Randy. “I got about ten more points than I
thought I’d have.”</p>

<p>All of the cadets who were to graduate that
year had passed, and they were, of course, correspondingly
elated.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to celebrate,” said Gif.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a farewell dinner,” suggested Jack.
“And it will be a real farewell, too—farewell to
Colby Hall, farewell to our offices, and farewell
to baseball, football, and everything else connected
with the Hall.”</p>

<p>From that minute on the boys to leave Colby
Hall forever were kept more than busy. The
Rovers helped to arrange for a final formal dinner,
and then lost no time in sending telegrams
home, telling the glad news of their having passed
the final tests.</p>

<p>“Now I think we deserve a real good vacation,”
said Fred.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it ought to be?” questioned
the young major. He had started to polish
his sword for the last time, preparatory to
making the best showing possible during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
military maneuvers which would help to mark
the closing of the term.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d like to take a long trip somewhere,”
answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d like to be shipwrecked again?”
observed Andy. “We might fall in with another
Ira Small and go after another pirates’ treasure,”
he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same with you fellows, I’ll stay
on land this summer,” said Randy. “I got all
the ocean I wanted when we drifted down to the
West Indies.”</p>

<p>The girls at Clearwater Hall did not finish their
examinations until the plans for the final dinner
at Colby Hall were well under way. Then it
was learned that both Martha and Mary, as well
as Ruth Stevenson, had passed with flying colors
and that May Powell had been only slightly behind.
This news came to the lads over the telephone.</p>

<p>“We ought to go over and congratulate them,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“I know what you want to do,” came from
Andy, as he winked one eye suggestively. “You
want to congratulate Ruth Stevenson.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you want to congratulate the
girls?” demanded the young major, his face reddening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Of course he does! We all do!” burst in
Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Andy, nodding sagely.
“Just the same, I’ll bet most of Fred’s congratulations
go to May Powell,” and then he had to
duck quickly in order to avoid a book which the
youngest Rover aimed at his head.</p>

<p>The boys did not get a chance to go over to
Clearwater Hall until the following day. In the
meanwhile they received congratulatory messages
from home which pleased them greatly. Then
came a letter for Randy marked “personal” which
filled that lad with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Randy’s best girl must be writing to him,”
suggested Fred, as he turned the missive over.
“Why don’t you let us know who she is, Randy?”</p>

<p>“Humph! I haven’t any best girl. And, anyway,
this letter is postmarked ‘New York.’ I
haven’t the least idea what’s in it.”</p>

<p>He tore the communication open and glanced
at the heading. Then he glanced at the signature.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s for Andy as well as for me! And
it’s from——” He stopped short. “Well, what
in the world can this be, anyhow?” And then,
as all of the other Rovers crowded closer, he
pushed Jack and Fred back. “Excuse me, boys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
but this is marked private and is for nobody
but Andy and myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” murmured Fred.</p>

<p>“What’s the big secret?” came blankly from
Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to find out myself,” answered Randy,
and thereupon he and Andy retreated to a corner
where they read the somewhat lengthy communication
from their father with keen interest.</p>

<p>“Gee, what do you know about that!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the best ever!”</p>

<p>“Say, it took dad to think up something worth
while, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hush now, or you’ll give it away. It’s to be
a secret, you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s a secret.”</p>

<p>So the talk ran on between the twins while
Fred and Jack looked on in silent amazement.</p>

<p>“Say, is this a game?” demanded the youthful
major, at last.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s a joke,” said Fred dryly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a joke. It’s the best news I’ve heard
since Noah gave up ship building,” cried Andy.
Then he added quickly to his brother: “Shall we
tell them anything at all?”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll have to tell them something, but
not <em>the</em> thing,” was the quick reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“We’re going to take a trip this summer, and
you two fellows are to go along.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” questioned Jack and
Fred simultaneously.</p>

<p>At this question the twins looked at each other
and slowly a broad grin appeared on the face
of each.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time Spouter Powell invited us
to take a trip with him. Only he didn’t tell us
where we were to go——” began Andy teasingly.</p>

<p>“And another time Gif Garrison did the same
thing, and then took us to Big Bear Lake,” added
Randy.</p>

<p>“See here! Is this another one of those
secrets?” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s it!”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit the nail on the head, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you won’t tell us where
we are to go?” flung out Fred.</p>

<p>“Nope! Can’t! Dad says we’re to keep it a
secret until we are ready to start.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Jack, we’ll pound it out of them!”
cried the youngest Rover, and sprang at the twins,
followed by his cousin.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! It won’t do you any good to
fight,” spluttered Randy, when he found himself
backed into a corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Then spill the beans, and spill ’em quick,”
ordered Jack.</p>

<p>“It’s all well enough for outsiders to keep a
secret,” broke in Fred. “There shouldn’t be any
secrets among us fellows. Come on! Tell us
where we’re to go.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it—not until the day we are leaving
school. Those are dad’s orders,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“And that’s the truth,” added his twin. “You’ll
know where you’re going to spend your vacation
on the day you’re ready to leave Colby Hall.”</p>

<p>“And we’re ordered to hide this letter where
nobody can get at it,” went on Randy. He looked
questioningly at his brother and then at his
cousins. “It’s mighty queer,” he continued, “but
that’s just what dad wrote down. You can figure
it out for yourselves if you want to.”</p>

<p>For a moment all of the Rover boys were silent,
each gazing at the others questioningly. Then,
of a sudden, Jack emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>“Well, if you fellows are telling the truth, and
I suppose you are, then I think I know the answer,”
he said.</p>

<p>“What is the answer?” demanded Fred.</p>

<p>“Davenport!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“My gracious, I wonder if you can be right!”
said Fred.</p>

<p>“I guess he is right,” answered Randy, “for
the letter says that Andy and I are not to mention
the place to anybody, nor are we to talk about
it in public. Especially, are we not to let the girls
know a thing about it. And, as I said before,
we are to hide this letter or destroy it.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m sure I’m right,” said the young
major. “Your father doesn’t want to run the
slightest risk of having Davenport find out where
we are going on our vacation.”</p>

<p>“I guess that demand for fifty thousand dollars
scared the folks at home a whole lot,” was Fred’s
comment. “It looks to me as if they imagined
Davenport was watching us every minute, trying
to figure out what he could do to injure us.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t seen or heard of the man since
the day we saw him—or Jack thought he did—in
that roadster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Just the same, he may be in this vicinity watching
every move we make,” said Randy, and his
face was serious.</p>

<p>The twins read the letter again, and then, to
make sure that no one else might know of its contents,
they burnt it up.</p>

<p>“No use of taking any chances,” said Andy
grimly.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, that letter got on my nerves,”
confessed his twin. “Dad wouldn’t write so seriously
unless there was something in the wind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Davenport—or some of those other
rascals—has been threatening the folks at home
again. Gosh! I wonder if they would dare
threaten my mother or Aunt Dora or Aunt
Nellie?”</p>

<p>“If Davenport or any of his pals did that he
ought to be shot!” answered Jack. “I’m sorry
now my dad didn’t have Davenport arrested the
first time he showed up. Such fellows ought to
be in prison. They ought never to be given their
liberty.”</p>

<p>When the boys telephoned to Clearwater Hall
they found that the girls had gone out for a walk
with one of the teachers. They were to be back
in less than an hour, however, so the lads concluded
to walk over to the girls’ school and wait
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The four Rovers, accompanied by Gif and
Spouter, had just reached a side entrance of the
Clearwater Hall grounds when they heard a cry
behind them. Looking up, they saw Mary,
Martha and Ruth hurrying from a patch of woods
with a teacher behind them.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had such a scare!” burst out
Martha, in excitement.</p>

<p>“If only you boys had been on hand perhaps
you might have helped us!” wailed Mary.</p>

<p>“What sort of a scare—wild animals, or a
ghost, or what?” queried Andy.</p>

<p>“No, it was a man—two men.”</p>

<p>“What did they do?” demanded Jack quickly.</p>

<p>“They didn’t do anything. I didn’t give them
a chance,” said the teacher, a tall, angular woman
who carried a stout walking stick and who looked
amply able to defend herself.</p>

<p>“The men were in a closed car, and they drove
up right alongside of Martha and me,” explained
Mary. “Ruth was walking ahead with Miss
Lambert. One of the men opened a door of the
car and asked us if we didn’t want to ride. Then
he jumped out and acted just as if he wanted
to make us get into the car, even if we didn’t
want to.”</p>

<p>“I called for Miss Lambert and Ruth,” said
Martha, “and as soon as the men saw the teacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
they went off in the car just as fast as they
could go.”</p>

<p>“How did the man who jumped out look?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“He was a tall man, with black hair and real
black eyes that seemed to look right through me,”
said Martha, and shivered a little as she spoke.
“Oh, he was a perfectly horrid man!”</p>

<p>“That was Carson Davenport, I’ll bet a dollar!”
exclaimed her brother. “Davenport is tall
and has black hair and black eyes.”</p>

<p>“What about the fellow who stayed in the car?”
asked Randy.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t see him very well. He had his
coat collar turned up and his cap pulled down over
his eyes.”</p>

<p>“I told Martha and Mary to stay close to us,”
said Miss Lambert, who evidently felt that she
must say something in her own defense. “But
they dropped behind, and this was the result.
However, I don’t think the men would have dared
to carry them off in such a high-handed fashion.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t say that if you knew this man
Davenport as we do,” answered Jack. “The
fellow has done time in prison and is a thorough
rascal and the associate of rascals.”</p>

<p>The girls were so excited that it was not until
they had entered Clearwater Hall and reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
to Miss Garwood, the head of the establishment,
that they could tell a clear and connected story.
No one had taken down the car number of the
automobile, nor had any one recognized the make
of the machine.</p>

<p>“All I can say is that it was a very fine car—nothing
cheap, like a Ford,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“If only we had the number it might help a
whole lot,” returned Fred.</p>

<p>“I think you two young ladies had better remain
within the school grounds until you start
for home,” said Miss Garwood at the conclusion
of the interview. “I cannot afford to have anything
happen to you while you are under my
care.” So it was arranged that Mary and Martha
should not go away from the school grounds until
they started for home.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll come and get you,” said Jack.
“And if Carson Davenport shows up we’ll give
him what is coming to him.”</p>

<p>“You bet we will!” added Fred. “And we’ll
give it to him with interest, too!”</p>

<p>In the excitement of the occasion the visitors
had almost forgotten to congratulate the girls on
their success in the examinations. It was plain
to be seen that Mary and Martha were both exceedingly
nervous, and Ruth was scarcely less
affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, do watch out that that man doesn’t
get you,” said Ruth to the young major, on parting.</p>

<p>“Well, you keep your eyes open while you girls
are here at school,” answered Jack. “If you see
the least sign of that rascal call somebody and
have him arrested.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be a good idea to
set a detective on his trail?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Ruth. But I think now that he has
failed in this new move of his he’ll keep under
cover for a while. He’ll probably wait until we
start for New York and then maybe follow us.”</p>

<p>“Martha and Mary want me to come down to
New York and spend a week or two there.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine, Ruth,” and Jack’s face
showed his satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was a rather sober group of cadets that returned
to Colby Hall. The Rovers had very little
to say.</p>

<p>“It’s a confounded shame!” was the way Gif
expressed himself. “Why should the authorities
let such a man out of prison? He ought to serve
every day of his sentence.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I look at it,” returned
Spouter. “What is the use of building prisons
and having them finely equipped if they are not
to be used? The whole trouble lies with those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
soft-hearted individuals in every community who
think prisoners ought to be treated with every
sort of consideration. Just look at some of them—carrying
fruit and flowers to murderers, and
weeping over people found guilty of kidnaping,
and all that sort of mush! Now, if I were in
authority, I’d give every man who was guilty
of a crime to understand that he must serve his
sentence to the last minute. And I’d give the
public to understand that——”</p>

<p>“Say, Spouter, are you only talking or are you
delivering a lecture?” broke in Randy.</p>

<p>“Well, it makes me mad!” went on the cadet
who loved to talk. “Don’t you agree with what
I’ve said?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” answered Jack. “There is
altogether too much soft-heartedness about this
criminal business.”</p>

<p>The final parade at Colby Hall was a formal
affair and attended by many people from Haven
Point and other places. Every uniform was
brushed and pressed and every rifle and sword
polished to the last degree. As a consequence
the three companies composing the school battalion
presented a well-nigh perfect appearance
when inspected by Colonel Colby and Captain
Dale.</p>

<p>“I must congratulate you on the fine showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
you have made,” said the master of the Hall, in
addressing the cadets. “I am proud of you. You
have done very well.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Colonel Colby!” called out
Jack, and the cheers were given with a will. Then
came another cheer for Captain Dale and the
other instructors.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Major Rover!” called out
Captain Dale, and once again the cheering was
renewed. Then came cheers for the captains of
the three commands and the other officers, after
which there was a final parade around the campus,
and then those who were to graduate from
the Hall discarded their arms for the last time.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take my sword home with me.
Colonel Colby said I might,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m to take my sword, too,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“What are Randy and I to take home?” demanded
Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can take an arithmetic or a grammar,”
answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Not on your tintype!” came from the fun-loving
Rover.</p>

<p>“We might take our guns,” suggested Randy
jokingly. “Then we’d be fully prepared to meet
Davenport and his pals.”</p>

<p>The dinner held by those who were to graduate
from the Hall was one long to be remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
The mess hall was decorated especially
for the occasion and the spread was one of the
most elaborate ever prepared at that institution.</p>

<p>“I want you boys to remember Colby Hall as
long as you live,” said Colonel Colby, addressing
a number of the cadets but looking squarely at the
Rover boys as he spoke. He did not say so, but
the lads knew he was thinking of his own school
days at Putnam Hall with their fathers.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t forget Colby Hall if I tried,” answered
Major Jack feelingly. “I am sure it’s one
of the best schools on earth.”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us!” cried Andy, and then
the crowd broke into prolonged cheering for
Colonel Colby and for everybody else connected
with the institution. There followed a number
of speeches and then a number of songs, and
the dinner did not break up until nearly midnight.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, boys, that was a grand
wind-up, and no mistake,” declared Fred, when
they were going upstairs to their rooms. “Colonel
Colby certainly deserves a medal for the way
he’s treated us.”</p>

<p>“It actually makes me sad to think I’m not
coming back here next fall,” remarked Jack.
“And I won’t be a major any more, either.”</p>

<p>“And I won’t be a captain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s one satisfaction,” said Andy, with
a grin. “You two highbrows have got to come
down to the level of us poor nobodies. Isn’t that
so, Randy?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. No more Major This or Captain
That.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t mind that,” answered Jack.
“Sometimes I think being major of the battalion
kept me out of some fun. A fellow holding such
an important office can’t do lots of things that
an ordinary cadet can.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m tired,” yawned Andy. “I’ll be glad
after all this hubbub to hit the hay and get a
sound sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” said Fred, as he threw open
one of the doors leading to the connecting rooms
which the cousins occupied.</p>

<p>The boys entered the rooms and then one after
another turned on the lights. Then came a sudden
exclamation from Jack.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! Who did this?”</p>

<p>“Who did what?” questioned Randy, and then
gave a swift look at the bed to which Jack was
pointing. “Why, all the bedclothes are gone!”
he added in dismay.</p>

<p>“All my bedclothing is gone too!” came from
Andy.</p>

<p>Then the four Rovers made a swift inspection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of the rooms. Each bed was destitute of its
sheets, pillowcases and blankets. Only the bare
pillows and mattresses remained.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose the housekeeper has cleared
these things away already?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” cried Randy. “This is a
trick, and I’m going after the fellows who did it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE LAST NIGHT AT COLBY HALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, it’s no more than we had a right to
expect,” said Andy, after a pause. “I was thinking
of playing a few tricks myself.”</p>

<p>“One thing is sure: We’ve got to have some
bedclothing before we go to bed,” muttered Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, we could sleep without if we had to—it’s
a warm night,” answered Jack. He had strode
over to a closet door and now pulled it open.
“Wow! What do you know about this!” he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>His cousins came rushing forward and each
gave a brief glance into the clothing closet. The
place was practically bare.</p>

<p>“All the clothing gone!”</p>

<p>“Even the pajamas are missing!”</p>

<p>“And the shoes and hats!”</p>

<p>Fred ran to another closet while Randy and his
twin darted into the other rooms of the suite.
A moment later each of the lads set up a howl
of dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“We have been cleaned out!”</p>

<p>“Everything is gone—even that old play suit I
was going to give away!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ve been robbed,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>“I doubt if any robbers would take the bedclothing,”
answered Jack. “It’s a trick—that’s
what it is!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if any of the other fellows have
suffered like this,” came from Andy.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been spoken when
there came a knock on the hallway door and Gif
entered, followed by Spouter.</p>

<p>“It’s the same story!” exclaimed Gif, glancing
at the empty beds. “You’ve been cleaned out
just the same as we were.”</p>

<p>“Were your closets ransacked too?” questioned
the young major quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything taken,” answered Spouter.
“Confound the luck, anyway! I was going to
do my packing to-night so that I’d have a little
time to myself in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I was going to get up early to pack,” answered
Fred.</p>

<p>“Has anybody else been cleaned out?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned Gif. “We stopped
at Ned Lowe’s room, and also asked Dan Soppinger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and they said nothing had been touched
in their rooms.”</p>

<p>Andy had walked to the corridor door and
opened it. As he glanced down the semi-dark
hallway he saw Fatty Hendry approaching.</p>

<p>“Say, Fatty,” he called out, “come here a minute!
A lot of our stuff has been taken from
our rooms. Do you know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” returned the stout cadet.
“What’s the matter—somebody play a trick on
you fellows?” And then, after Andy had explained
briefly, Fatty continued: “Maybe I can
give you a clew. A while ago I came upstairs
to get a book I had promised to Phil Franklin.
As I came past here I saw Dock Wesley at your
door. He looked rather scared and slid down
the corridor as fast as he could. He had something
under his arm.”</p>

<p>“Dock Wesley!” repeated Jack. “Why, he’s
the new kid who is chumming with Codfish!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t put it past Codfish to try something
like this to get square for being exposed
the way he was,” remarked Fred, who had followed
Andy to the doorway.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see anybody else, Fatty?” asked
Randy, who had joined the others.</p>

<p>“Not a soul. But wait a minute! Come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
think of it, I did meet Wesley and Codfish a
little later, along with some of the other fellows,
and the bunch were having a good laugh over
something.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess we have struck a clew,” declared
Fred. “Come on, and we’ll soon get to the
bottom of this.”</p>

<p>The Rover boys, followed by Gif, Spouter and
Fatty, hurried down the corridor and around a
corner where was located the room occupied by
Codfish and Dock Wesley. They knocked on the
door, but to this there was no response. Then
they knocked again, and at last a somewhat faltering
voice asked who was there.</p>

<p>“It’s Major Rover,” called out Jack. “Stowell,
I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve gone to bed,” answered Codfish weakly.
“I’m all tired out. Can’t you do your talking
to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. I want to do it now.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to open the door,” declared
Codfish. “You want to play some kind of a trick
on me.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! Don’t open up,” came in Dock
Wesley’s voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that I am major of the battalion,”
went on Jack sternly. “I want both of
you to obey orders and open this door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“You’re not major any longer, Jack Rover!”
cried Wesley. “Your commission went out of
date to-day. You’re nothing but a student like
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t bulldoze me any longer,” put in
Codfish, gaining a little courage by his chum’s
manner. “I won’t stand for it. You go away
and let us go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Open that door or we’ll break it down!” cried
Fred.</p>

<p>“You break that door down and you’ll get a
baseball bat over your head!” stormed Wesley.
“I’ve got a bat here, and so has Stowell, and we’ll
both use ’em, too, if you try any funny business.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! I’ve got a plan,” whispered
Andy. “Come here,” and he drew several feet
away from the door.</p>

<p>“What do you propose?” questioned Gif.</p>

<p>“Jack, Fred, Spouter and Fatty can stay at the
door and argue with Codfish and Wesley just as
hard as possible so as to keep ’em interested. In
the meanwhile, Randy and Gif and I can go
around and get on the fire escape that runs under
their window. Most likely their window is open
and we’ll be able to sneak into the room. If we
can do that Randy and I can hold both of them
back while Gif unlocks the door and lets you
fellows in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, that’s the stuff!” answered Randy, in a
whisper, his eyes glistening. “Come on! Let’s
get busy!”</p>

<p>The others were willing, and while Jack, Fred,
Spouter and Hendry returned to the locked door,
the others, led by Andy, disappeared around the
corridor corner in the direction where a door led
out to a long fire escape.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be careful and make no noise,”
whispered Andy. “Otherwise they may get on
to the trick and lock the window and barricade
it with a chiffonier or something. Then we’ll
be out of it altogether.”</p>

<p>It was easy to get out on the fire escape, and,
once there, the three cadets crawled cautiously
along past several windows, coming finally to the
window belonging to the room occupied by Codfish
and Wesley.</p>

<p>“The window is open,” whispered Andy, after
taking a cautious look. “All we’ve got to do is
to raise the screen and leap inside.”</p>

<p>“Wait now!” returned his twin. “Let’s have
everything understood. Take a look inside if you
can without being seen.”</p>

<p>The light was lit in the room and by this, peering
cautiously over the window sill, the cadets
outside saw Codfish and Wesley standing close
to the locked door, each with a baseball bat in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
his hands. Both were arguing loudly with those
in the corridor.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’ll notice us,” whispered
Andy. “Everybody is talking too loud. Come
on now. Grab the bats first of all. And you,
Gif, try to get to the door and unlock it.”</p>

<p>“Is the key in it? Maybe they have taken it
out.”</p>

<p>“No, the key is there,” said Andy. “Now then!
Be quick!”</p>

<p>Cautiously he raised the window screen and as
soon as it was high enough Gif stepped into the
room, followed immediately by the two Rovers.
Their entrance was not noticed, for Jack was laying
down the law in the hall outside and Codfish
and Wesley were listening attentively.</p>

<p>“Now!” cried Randy, and hurled himself at
Codfish while Andy leaped upon Wesley. Gif
went between, reaching the door with scarcely
an effort. For a few seconds there was a terrible
mêlée in the rather small room. Andy managed
to get the bat away from his opponent and then
the two grappled and fell to the floor. In the
meantime his twin also became engaged in a fierce
scuffle. In the midst of this Gif flung open the
door and into the room poured all of the others,
and then the impromptu battle came to a sudden
termination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t hit me! Don’t hit me!” screamed Codfish,
in terror as Randy stood over him, baseball
bat in hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of all this?” demanded
Dock Wesley, sitting down on the edge of a bed
and scowling at those in front of him. “Going
to start a rough house?”</p>

<p>“No, we’re going to bring you fellows to book,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“I guess we had better bind and gag ’em and
throw ’em into the lake,” suggested Gif, with a
wink at his chums.</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t do anything like that!” cried
Codfish, more frightened than ever. “Let me
alone! Please!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Codfish, what did you and your
bunch do with our things?” demanded Randy.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell ’em anything,” snarled Wesley.
“Keep your mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s what you intend to do, is it?”
came from Spouter. “How do you like that?”
and he suddenly caught Wesley by the collar and
laid him out flat on the bed. “Let’s strip ’em,
boys, and give ’em the licking they deserve!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch me! Don’t you dare! I’ll
have you arrested!” howled Wesley, and now he
seemed to be as much frightened as Codfish. He
was a coward at heart, and that was one reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
he had sought the companionship of such a sneak
as Stowell.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” declared Jack. “We’ll bind and
gag ’em and take ’em down to the gymnasium.
There we’ll give ’em a good lashing with a horsewhip
and then throw ’em both into the lake. That
will give ’em something to remember us by,” and
he winked suggestively at his cousins and his
chums.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” said Randy, taking up the
cue. “We’ll give ’em the licking of their lives.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” declared Fred. “And we’ll tie
’em in potato sacks before we heave ’em overboard.”</p>

<p>“They both wanted to sleep—we’ll let them
sleep with the fishes for a while,” declared
Spouter.</p>

<p>It is possible that Codfish and his crony did
not believe all that their tormentors said. Yet
they felt that they were in for a rough time of
it and that matters might be carried further than
intended.</p>

<p>“Wha-what did you come he-here for?” faltered
Codfish.</p>

<p>“You know well enough what we came for,”
declared Fred.</p>

<p>“It was only a—a joke, Fred Rover! Indeed
it was!” pleaded the sneak of the school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Shut up! Why can’t you shut up?” stormed
Wesley. “That’s no way to spill the beans. If
you’d only—— Oh!” And his talk came to a
sudden end as he found himself flat on the floor,
sent there by Gif and Spouter. Then, before he
could get up, Randy emptied a pitcher of ice-water
over him.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Let me up!” spluttered Wesley.
“Ouch! that’s ice-water, don’t you know it? Let
up!” and he tried to rise, but one of the boys
sat on his chest and another on his legs and kept
him down.</p>

<p>In the meantime the others got Codfish into a
corner and Jack took the sneak by the ear. He
looked at Codfish so menacingly that the sneak
of the school was almost paralyzed.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit me, Major Rover! Please don’t!”
he half sobbed. “I’ll tell you everything! We
didn’t mean any harm! It was only done in fun.
I’ll tell you where we took your clothing and the
bed things!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<small>TIT FOR TAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>After that it was a comparatively easy matter
to get Henry Stowell to tell the details of what
had been done. Several times Dock Wesley tried
to stop him, but finally he also capitulated and
became almost as humble as the sneak.</p>

<p>“It was only a bit of fun,” said Wesley. “Can’t
a fellow do something on the last night at
school?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“But you’ve got to take your dose in return,”
was Fatty Hendry’s comment.</p>

<p>Thereupon Codfish and Wesley admitted that
they and four other cadets had entered the rooms
occupied by the Rovers and their chums and taken
away all their clothing and their bed things.</p>

<p>“Everything is locked up safe and sound in
Room Forty-two,” said Codfish. “You know,
that room hasn’t been occupied this term.”</p>

<p>“How did you get the key?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“We got it one day from the janitor when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
was cleaning up. He thought he had lost it, and
so locked up with a duplicate.”</p>

<p>“Where is the key now?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I—I let Dock keep it,” faltered Codfish.</p>

<p>“Say, you needn’t put off everything on me,”
growled Wesley. “You had as much to do with
this as anybody. The key is on a hook in that
closet,” and Wesley nodded toward a closet in a
corner.</p>

<p>“Now we want to know who the other fellows
were,” declared Fred, after the key had been
secured.</p>

<p>“Oh, you had better not ask that,” pleaded the
sneak. “If we give them away they may hammer
the daylights out of us.”</p>

<p>“You talk up, Codfish, or you may get the
hammering right now,” put in Gif.</p>

<p>Thereupon Codfish mentioned the names of
four cadets who had been more or less chummy
with him since the term had started. Two were
new boys, and all were fellows with whom the
Rovers and their chums had had little to do.</p>

<p>“Now put on your slippers and come along
with us,” ordered Jack.</p>

<p>“What do you want of us?” questioned Wesley.</p>

<p>“First of all, you’re going to bring all that stuff
back,” declared the young major. “After that
we’ll see what we’ll do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you make the other fellows join
us?” asked Codfish. He thought there might be
safety in numbers.</p>

<p>“We’ll take care of them later on,” put in Gif
grimly.</p>

<p>Finding themselves cornered, Codfish and Wesley
accompanied the others to Room 42, and there
on the bed, on the chairs, and on the floor they
found all the things taken from the Rovers and
Gif and Spouter.</p>

<p>“I call this something of a mess,” declared
Fatty, who had come along. “Here, give me
some of that clothing! I’ll help carry it.”</p>

<p>Even with the assistance of those who had
suffered from the joke, it was necessary to make
several trips back and forth to get all the things
where they belonged. During the last trip Fred
and Andy noticed some other cadets hiding in the
shadows at the end of the corridor and laughing
softly among themselves.</p>

<p>“They think they’ve got the joke on us,” whispered
Fred. “Come on, let us make a break for
them.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I’ve got a better plan,” came from
Randy.</p>

<p>After everything had been restored to the
rooms, the Rovers and their chums marched Codfish
and Wesley back to their own quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“Now then, I think we’ll give you a dose of
your own medicine,” said the young major.
“Boys, pick up all that extra clothing and all
those quilts and bedsheets and put them in the
closet over there.”</p>

<p>“Say, what does this mean?” demanded Wesley.</p>

<p>“You’ll see in a minute.”</p>

<p>The others were quick to catch the idea, and
all the bed coverings, as well as the wearing apparel
in the room, were quickly transferred to
the closet.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave you your pajamas, for you might
catch cold,” said Randy. Then the closet door
was locked and the key taken away.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t try to raise a row, or you’ll be
sure to get the worst of it,” said Jack, as the
crowd prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>“We can’t stay here with nothing on the beds!”
cried Codfish.</p>

<p>“You thought we could do it, didn’t you?”
asked Andy. “It’s simply tit for tat. Go on and
lie down and enjoy yourselves.” And thereupon
the Rovers and their chums withdrew, locking
the door after them.</p>

<p>“I guess that will hold them for a while,” remarked
Spouter. “They can’t get their things
unless they break open the door, and I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
think they’ll go that far. And they can’t get out
unless they go on the fire escape, and the door
from there to the corridor is locked on the inside—they’d
have to go through some of the other
fellows’ rooms.”</p>

<p>“Now then, how are we going to square up
with those other fellows?” asked Gif.</p>

<p>“I was thinking I might sneak down and get
old Huxley’s garden syringe—the one he uses to
spray the bushes and flowers with,” said Andy.
“We might give ’em all a dose of ice-water, or
something like that.”</p>

<p>“Old stuff,” declared Fred. “Can’t we think
of something new?”</p>

<p>“We might blow some smoke through the keyholes
or under the doors,” suggested Randy.
“Then we could bang on the door and let them
think there was a fire.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! that isn’t half bad,” said Fred. “But
how shall we make the smoke? We can’t build
a fire, or anything of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Some wet paper will do the trick.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to try that, boys,”
declared Jack. “It might bring on a panic, and
we don’t want any one to be hurt on this, the
last night at the Hall. Come on and see if we
can’t get hold of those fellows.”</p>

<p>They passed around a corner of the corridor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and as they did so Gif suddenly clutched the
youngest Rover by the arm.</p>

<p>“There go some fellows now!” he whispered.
“See them crawling along over there? I wonder
who they are and what they’re up to?”</p>

<p>The lights in the hallway had been turned low,
and the Rovers and their chums could just make
out the forms of four cadets slinking along
silently. Then they disappeared from view
around one of the numerous corners.</p>

<p>Curious to know what new fun might be in
the air, the Rovers and the others followed the
crowd like so many shadows. They saw the
four cadets who were ahead stop in front of
the room which they had left but a few moments
before.</p>

<p>“Gee, I know that crowd!” exclaimed Andy,
in a low voice. “Those are the very fellows
Codfish and Wesley mentioned—the fellows who
helped them take our things.”</p>

<p>“They must be wanting to know what we were
doing here,” suggested Gif. “Say, why can’t we
pounce on ’em and make ’em prisoners? We are
seven to four.”</p>

<p>“I’m game if you fellows are,” answered Randy
readily.</p>

<p>A plan was hastily formed, and just as the
four cadets had begun their talk with Codfish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and Wesley, out of the semi-darkness pounced
the Rovers and their chums.</p>

<p>“Give in! Give in!” was the whispered command.
“Give in or you’ll get the licking of your
lives!”</p>

<p>“Hi! Stop that!” roared one of the cadets, a
lad named Morris. “Let up!”</p>

<p>“Do-do-don’t ch-choke me to death!” spluttered
a cadet named Shamberg. “Let up, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“It’s the Rovers!” came from a third of the
lads.</p>

<p>“They’ve found us out!” wailed the fourth, a
fellow who was just as much of a sneak and
coward as Codfish had ever been.</p>

<p>Surrounded and taken completely off their
guard, the four cadets were speedily made prisoners.
Then, almost before they knew what was
happening, they were taken to the two adjoining
rooms which they chanced to occupy. One of
the rooms had a rather large closet which at one
time had been a storeroom. It had a small window
about five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” said Jack. “Throw a mattress
in here on the floor.”</p>

<p>The others quickly caught on and in a trice
a mattress from one of the beds was flung on
the floor of the storeroom. Then the four cadets
who had been captured were forced into the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Now you fellows can stay here until morning,”
declared Jack. “You didn’t want us to
have a decent night’s sleep, so now you can get
along in any old way you please. Don’t dare
to make a rumpus, or we’ll be after you in a way
you least expect.”</p>

<p>“Gee, we’ll smother to death in here this warm
night!” declared Morris.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” said Spouter. “You can take
turns at looking out of the window. But I’d
advise you not to crawl out, because it’s about
twenty-five feet to the ground.”</p>

<p>“We’ll report this to-morrow, you see if we
don’t,” grumbled Shamberg.</p>

<p>“Report and be hanged,” retorted Gif. “If you
say a word to Colonel Colby we’ll tell him what
you did.” And thereupon the Rovers and their
chums withdrew, locking the storeroom door and
then locking the door to the corridor.</p>

<p>It was a good quarter of an hour after Gif,
Spouter and Fatty had left them that the Rovers
were able to rearrange their beds so that they
could lie down. All were now thoroughly tired
out and Andy could scarcely keep his eyes open.
But there was to be little sleep for any of the
cadets during that last night at Colby Hall. Half
a dozen parties were wandering around, making
all the fun possible, and presently Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Snopper Duke came after some of the boys, trying
to quiet them.</p>

<p>“This is disgraceful!” stormed the irate teacher.
“I want you boys to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>Then came an alarm from Codfish and Wesley,
as several other cadets broke into their room,
bent upon bringing the sneak and his chum to
terms for something done in the classroom the
week before. Into this row Snopper Duke precipitated
himself, and as a consequence was struck
in the nose by a baseball which one of the lads
threw at Codfish.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, my nose! Who threw that baseball?”
roared the teacher. Then, as the blood began to
flow from the injured organ, he hastened off to
the nearest bathroom where he might bathe it.</p>

<p>It was all of three o’clock before the Rovers
got any sleep at all. By half past six they were
again awake and busy packing their things, ready
to depart. Then Randy and Andy sneaked away
and liberated Morris, Shamberg and the other
two with them.</p>

<p>“Hope you slept well,” said Andy, grinning.</p>

<p>“You let me get my hands on you, and I’ll
show you how I slept,” stormed Morris. But
then Andy ran off laughing and his twin followed
him. The other boys were very sore, but did not
dare to do anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“And now to get the girls and start for home!”
said Jack, a short while after breakfast.</p>

<p>“And then for our vacation!” added Fred. “If
only we knew where it was going to be!”</p>

<p>“You’ll know very soon,” declared Andy.
“Randy and I have made up our minds to tell
you as soon as we are ready to leave Haven
Point.”</p>

<small>A MYSTERIOUS PLOT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Good-by, boys. I wish all of you the best of
luck.”</p>

<p>It was Colonel Colby who spoke as he shook
hands with the Rover boys and a number of the
other cadets.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Colonel. I hope we see you again
some time,” returned Jack.</p>

<p>“You must come and visit us at our home
when you can get time,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“I will certainly come when I can get away,”
was the reply from the master of the school.</p>

<p>Breakfast was at an end and all was bustle
and confusion as the cadets were hurrying in
all directions, suitcases in hand, ready to leave
the Hall. Many were going away in automobiles
which lined one side of the campus drive. Others
were to go to the Haven Point railroad station.
A motor truck had already taken two loads of
trunks away and was now back for a third.</p>

<p>“Good-by, fellows!” cried Gif. “Hope you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
have a good time.” He and Spouter had arranged
to go up on the coast of Maine with Dan Soppinger
and their folks.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” cried the Rovers, and a few minutes
later had entered the touring car which was
to take them away.</p>

<p>“Here is something to remember us by!”
shouted Spouter gayly, and threw a bunch of confetti
over the Rovers.</p>

<p>“And here is something to remember me by!”
yelled Andy, as the car moved away and he
hurled an old shoe he had picked up at Spouter,
catching that cadet in the stomach, causing him
to give a grunt of surprise. Then the touring
car rolled out of the grounds, all of the boys
waving their hands as the place faded from their
sight.</p>

<p>“Now it is good-by to Colby Hall and hurrah
for a vacation!” exclaimed Fred. Then he added
quickly: “Now then, Andy and Randy, where
are we to go? Don’t keep me waiting any longer.
I’m all on fire with suspense,” and the youngest
Rover put on a tragic air.</p>

<p>“Wait till we pick up the girls,” pleaded Andy.
“No use in going over the whole thing twice.
They’ll want to know about it, anyway.”</p>

<p>It had already been arranged that Martha and
Mary, along with Ruth, were to accompany the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
lads to New York City. Although the others did
not know it, Jack went armed, having obtained
the loan of a pistol from Colonel Colby, who had
been told the particulars regarding the rascality
of Carson Davenport.</p>

<p>“I feel that I am responsible for the safety
of my sister and my cousin,” the young major
had told the master of the school. “I want to
be sure that they get home safely.” And thereupon
Colonel Colby had somewhat reluctantly
permitted Jack to take his own private nickel-plated
pistol.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at Clearwater Hall they
found the three girls waiting for them. A few
minutes later the whole crowd was off for the
Haven Point railroad station.</p>

<p>“Have you seen or heard anything more of that
man Davenport?” questioned Mary anxiously, as
they rode along.</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Mary,” answered her brother.
“Have you?”</p>

<p>“Two or three times we saw somebody skulking
in the bushes back of the school,” said the
girl. “It was rather dark, and the man was so
far off we couldn’t tell who he was, although
Martha thought he walked like the fellow who
tried to push us into the auto.”</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to reach the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
station, and during that time Andy and Randy
had no opportunity to speak of the trip the lads
intended to take during their vacation. At the
station they fell in with a number of the cadets,
including Phil Franklin.</p>

<p>“I’ve arranged to stay with Mrs. Logan,” said
Phil. “And I think Barry and I are going to
have some bang-up times.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to look for the silver trophy,”
said Jack quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve already spoken to Barry about that,”
answered the boy from the oil fields. “We’re
going to make a systematic hunt. Of course, it
isn’t going to be very easy to locate the exact spot
where the vase went down.”</p>

<p>“It was opposite that clump of big pines,”
declared Randy. “I noticed the pines just as I
went overboard,” he added, with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that—it ought to help us in
locating the spot,” said Phil, and then walked
away to bid some of his other friends good-by.</p>

<p>“Now then, Andy and Randy, tell us where
we’re going!” cried Fred, when the Rover boys
and girls and Ruth were left for a moment to
themselves.</p>

<p>“You’re going out West,” answered Andy
dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Out West? Where?” came from Jack and
Fred.</p>

<p>“You’re going out to the Rolling Thunder gold
mine,” said Randy.</p>

<p>“Rolling Thunder! What a name!” exclaimed
Ruth, dimpling.</p>

<p>“Where in thunder is Rolling Thunder?” demanded
Fred. “I never heard of such a gold
mine.”</p>

<p>“I have,” put in Jack quickly. “It’s the one
Uncle Tom invested in a couple of years ago.
I’m right, am I not?” he questioned of the twins.</p>

<p>“That’s it. It’s away out in the Rocky Mountains
near a place called Maporah. It’s on what
is known as Sunset Trail.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that sounds good! Sunset Trail!” murmured
Fred.</p>

<p>“How are we to go? In an auto?” queried
Jack.</p>

<p>“Hardly! We’re to take the train to Chicago
and then another train to Maporah. From there
we take horses and ride to a place called Gold
Hill Falls where the mine is located. Dad says
we ought to have a dandy time on Sunset Trail.”</p>

<p>“He says it’s a very wild country, with plenty
of good hunting and fishing, and all that sort
of thing,” came from the other twin. “He says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
we can go out either with a guide or by ourselves,
just as we please.”</p>

<p>“That sounds mighty good to me,” said Fred,
his eyes brightening. “I’d like to spend a few
weeks in the saddle, and I’d like to go where
there is some real fishing.”</p>

<p>“Suppose some Indians catch you and scalp
you?” put in his sister mischievously.</p>

<p>“Indians! Humph! If there are any Indians
out there more than likely some of them are from
college and on the baseball or football teams,”
was the quick retort. “The old-fashioned Indians
exist only in the story books.”</p>

<p>The boys and girls became greatly interested
in the subject of the outing and talked about
it freely until it was time for the train to arrive.
Then they bustled around to say good-by to
those who were to leave in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Gee, it makes me feel awfully queer to think
I’m never coming back to Colby Hall!” murmured
Fred, as he shook hands with one and another
of the cadets.</p>

<p>“This place has certainly been a second home
to us,” answered Jack. “No matter what happens
in the future, I’ll never forget the days
spent here.”</p>

<p>“None of us will!” cried Randy.</p>

<p>“They were great days, the best of days, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
spite of such fellows as Codfish, Gabe Werner,
Bill Glutts, and Professor Duke,” declared the
young major.</p>

<p>The girls were likewise in a flutter bidding
farewell to their chums and also several of the
teachers who were leaving. In the midst of all
this excitement the train rolled in and a few
seconds later boys and girls climbed aboard and
the Rovers rushed down the aisle to get comfortable
seats.</p>

<p>“Good-by to Haven Point!” shouted Andy, out
of the window, and then opening a bag of popcorn
he had purchased he scattered the entire
contents over the heads of those left behind.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, look at that!” was the cry. “Popcorn!
Did you ever!”</p>

<p>“That was Andy Rover! He’s always cutting
up!”</p>

<p>“Here you are, Andy!” yelled Phil Franklin,
in excitement, and just as the train started he
sent a rubber ball whizzing through the open
window of the car. The ball struck Andy in the
ear, then bounced away into Ruth’s lap.</p>

<p>“Hi! We don’t want your ball!” called out
Andy, and, catching it up, he threw it through
the window, hitting the cadet named Morris in
the chin. Then the train rolled away, and the
journey to New York City was begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>As the train passed out of sight two men, one
about middle age and the other very much
younger, stepped from a corner of a baggage
room which was located close to where the Rover
boys and those with them had been standing.</p>

<p>“I guess you got the right dope that time,
Davenport,” said the younger man, as both walked
away unnoticed and entered a roadster standing
on a side road behind some bushes.</p>

<p>“I think I did,” answered Carson Davenport,
his manner showing his satisfaction. “So they
are going to Chicago and then to Maporah, and
then out on Sunset Trail, eh? I’ll have to look
into that.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about the Sunset Trail
territory?” questioned the younger man.</p>

<p>“I do and I don’t,” was Davenport’s reply.
“I was never there myself. But Tate, the fellow
I’ve been telling you about, came from that district
and he’s often told me about it. He spoke
about this Rolling Thunder mine, too. He knows
some of the fellows working there.”</p>

<p>“Then what you’ve got in mind ought to be
easy, Davenport.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about its being so easy! Those
Rovers are not fools and since we made a mess
of things the other day, more than likely they’ll
be on their guard. I reckon I made something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
of a mistake when I called on Dick Rover. I
should have waited until I had things better in
hand.”</p>

<p>“What is the next move?”</p>

<p>“I think we had better follow them to New
York, and then you had better find out a few
more details of their plans.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do that yourself?”</p>

<p>“They know me, and they don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“They saw me out riding with you.”</p>

<p>“True! But I don’t think they’ll remember
you. Anyway, you can easily put on some sort
of a disguise. You can bump into the boys and
pretend to get friendly and all that sort of thing,”
went on the man from the oil fields.</p>

<p>“All right, Davenport, I’ll do whatever you
want me to,” returned the younger man. “But
understand, I’m not doing this for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I understand that well enough. And I’m not
doing it for nothing either. If we work this
thing right there will be a small fortune in it
for all of us.”</p>

<small>HOME ONCE MORE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Here we are at last!”</p>

<p>It was Fred who spoke as the long train rolled
into the Grand Central Terminal, New York City,
and came to a stop. The boys had collected their
hand baggage and soon the Rovers and Ruth
were in the midst of the crowd that was pouring
through the gateway into the waiting room of
the big station.</p>

<p>“Here you are—and glad to see you!” exclaimed
Dick Rover, as he came up, followed
by his wife and Fred’s mother.</p>

<p>There was a general handshaking and many
kisses, and then Dick Rover took possession of
the young folks’ checks for their trunks and led
the way to a side street where two of the family
touring cars waited.</p>

<p>The trip to the metropolis had been without
special incident save for the fact that a number
of the cadets, including Andy and Randy, were
inclined to indulge in more or less horseplay on
the way. They had had to make one change at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the Junction, and on account of the heavy travel
had been compelled to come down in an ordinary
day coach in place of getting seats in a parlor
car. They had managed, however, to get lunch
on the train and had had considerable fun during
the meal.</p>

<p>“I am certainly glad to see you young folks
home again,” remarked Dora Rover, as she gazed
affectionately at her son and daughter and then
at the others. “And you are more than welcome,
Ruth,” she added, tapping the visitor on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’re not glad to see little old New
York again!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d call it ‘little old New York,’”
answered Ruth, with a smile. “To me it’s a
wonderfully big and busy city. When I first
arrive here I always feel like shrinking back until
I can get my bearings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, New York is just all right. I wouldn’t
want it any better,” answered Randy.</p>

<p>“But you don’t want to stay here even when
you come,” put in his Aunt Grace. “You just
stay at home a few days and then away you go
on one of those trips.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a Rover by name, so why not be
a rover by nature?” was the sly reply, and this
brought on a general laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>Soon the young folks were aboard the two
automobiles. In the meantime Dick Rover had
turned the checks for the trunks over to an expressman
and in a few minutes more the whole
crowd was headed for Riverside Drive. Here a
surprise awaited them. Not only was Mrs. Tom
Rover on hand to greet them, but likewise their
grandfather, Anderson Rover, and their old Aunt
Martha and Uncle Randolph, who had come from
Valley Brook Farm on a short visit to the city.</p>

<p>“My gracious, this is fine!” cried Fred. “A
regular family reunion!” and then came more
hugs and kisses all around.</p>

<p>“My, my! how big you boys are getting!” said
old Aunt Martha, as she surveyed them through
her spectacles. “The first thing you know, you
won’t be boys any more—you’ll be men.”</p>

<p>“Well, you couldn’t expect them to remain boys
all their life, could you?” queried Uncle Randolph.
“Now they have graduated from Colby
Hall, I suppose they’ll either have to go to college
or go into business.”</p>

<p>“No use of shoving them ahead too quickly,”
came from Grandfather Rover, as he sat down
and rested his chin on the top of his cane. “They
have been studying pretty hard for years—let
’em take a rest. They might take a whole year,
if it was necessary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, Granddad, you’re a pippin!” exclaimed
Randy, going up and placing his arm around the
old man’s shoulder. “A year’s vacation would
be all to the mustard.”</p>

<p>“It might be if you could only get rid of some
of your slang in the meantime,” put in his mother.
Yet she had to smile as she spoke.</p>

<p>The boys were glad to get back into their old
quarters, and in the meantime Martha escorted
Ruth to the room she was to occupy during her
visit. All the connecting doors of the three houses
had been thrown wide open, making the residences
virtually one. While this was going on
Dick Rover hurried back to Wall Street, for business
with The Rover Company was brisk and
he was needed at the offices.</p>

<p>“You must be making a lot of money, Dad,”
remarked Jack, as his parent was leaving.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re holding our own, Jack,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“How are the oil wells making out?”</p>

<p>“Very fine.” Dick Rover stepped closer to his
son. “Did you hear anything from Carson Davenport?”
he asked in a low tone so that the others
might not hear.</p>

<p>“Nothing since the girls met him. They said
they sent word about that.”</p>

<p>“You want to be very careful, Jack. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
talk the whole thing over to-night. That rascal
is certainly going to put one over on us if he
possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Why did they let him out of prison?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He may have got a number
of important friends to appear for him before
a board of pardons, or something like that. Then
again, you must remember that what he was tried
for was his trouble with his partners. I did
not want to appear against him because it would
have taken too much of my time, which, just
then, was very valuable to our concern. It’s possible
that he got the very people he swindled—or
tried to swindle—to sign a petition in his favor
and in favor of his other partners, Tate and Jackson.
But I must hurry now. We can talk the
whole thing over later.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon the twins went out to
renew their acquaintance with some of their
former boy chums while Jack and Fred accompanied
the girls on a sightseeing and shopping
expedition.</p>

<p>“I’ll be awfully sorry to leave you, Ruth,” said
Jack, when he got a chance to speak to the visitor
alone.</p>

<p>“Well, then you’d better stay,” she answered
mischievously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I couldn’t do that,” he returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
hastily. “What would the other fellows
say?”</p>

<p>“I was only joking, Jack. You go ahead and
have your outing. I hope you enjoy every minute
of it. Only, please don’t get into any trouble,”
and the girl’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll be able to take care of ourselves,
Ruth. And you take care of yourself, too.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to write?”</p>

<p>“Sure I am! And I’ll expect you to answer,
too. You will, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, neither of them seeming
to know what to say next. Then the former
major of the Colby Hall battalion stepped closer.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take that photograph of you
along—you know, the one you gave me some
time ago,” he said in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Never!” she returned quickly. “Oh, Jack,
suppose—suppose the others saw it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! I’m going to take it,” he answered
firmly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re set on it, I suppose I can’t
stop you,” answered Ruth. Her eyes were shining
like stars. Then Jack caught her hand and
pressed it warmly just as the others came up and
interrupted what might have proved a very interesting
tête-à-tête.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Dinner that evening was a grand affair, and
Ruth, who sat next to Jack, declared she had
never enjoyed anything so much in all her life.
The twins and Tom Rover were full of fun, and
Tom told several stories which convulsed everybody
with laughter.</p>

<p>“Gee, Dad, you’re a wonder!” breathed Randy,
trying to stop laughing. “I can see where Andy
gets his wit from.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know where you get your habit
of playing tricks from,” put in his mother, gazing
fondly at her husband.</p>

<p>“Now, now! No knocking!” cried Tom gayly.
“The boys are just all right! They may cut up
a little now and then, but as they both bear marks
of their mother’s good looks, that will be forgiven
them,” and then Tom dodged back, as his
wife made a move as if to pull his hair.</p>

<p>Ruth was quite a pianist and had cultivated
that talent carefully during her days at Clearwater
Hall. After dinner Dora Rover insisted
that the girl give them some music. After playing
one of her best compositions Ruth gathered
all the boys and girls around her and they sang
one popular song after another.</p>

<p>“A touch of old times, eh?” said Dick Rover
to Dora, as, with his arm around her waist, they
surveyed the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“It’s history repeating itself, Dick,” she answered.
And then she looked at her husband
questioningly and nodded toward where Jack was
carefully turning the sheets of music for Ruth.
“What do you think of them?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I think Jack is hit pretty hard,” he returned.</p>

<p>“Well, Ruth seems to be an awfully nice girl,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“I agree. I wouldn’t ask for a better girl,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“But Jack is so young!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t any younger than I was when I came
after you and saved your mother from old Crabtree.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that was different!” murmured
Dora.</p>

<p>So far the boys had had no opportunity to
speak to Tom Rover about the proposed trip to
the West. But soon the twins broached the subject,
and then the crowd around the piano broke
up and Mary and Martha retired, taking Ruth
with them.</p>

<p>“We want to talk to the boys in the library,”
said Tom Rover to his wife and his sisters-in-law,
and thereupon the ladies took the hint and
also left them.</p>

<p>“Now, Dad, tell us all about the Rolling Thunder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
mine and Sunset Trail!” cried Randy. “Gee,
I wish I was out there right now!”</p>

<p>“And on horseback!” put in his twin. “Say,
we’ll have the best times ever!”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope so,” returned Dick Rover.
“At the same time, I want to caution you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t scare the boys into fits, Dick,” said
Tom. “You’ll spoil the whole outing if you do.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to scare them into fits, Tom,”
answered the older brother. “But I am going to
give them some advice that I think they ought
to have.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” came from Sam Rover. “If
any fellow ever got on my nerves, it’s that rascal,
Carson Davenport.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The mention of Carson Davenport’s name
made all the boys look serious.</p>

<p>“Has that fellow made another demand?” questioned
Jack quickly.</p>

<p>“Not directly,” answered his father. “But I
have heard in an indirect way, through a detective
working for one of the local agencies, that
he is watching us very carefully. He has been
seen in the vicinity of our offices several times,
and you have seen him twice in the vicinity of
Colby Hall and Clearwater Hall. That’s enough
for me to realize that the scoundrel means business.”</p>

<p>“You forgot to mention one thing, Dick,” came
from Fred’s father. “Another one of the detectives
from that agency saw Davenport in this
vicinity less than three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Here at the houses?”
questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“Yes. He was out on the Drive, skulking up
and down looking at all the doors and windows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
And he asked one of the tradesmen who lived
here, evidently to make sure that he had the right
place.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they arrest him?” questioned Andy
impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re going to do as soon as we
can get any real evidence against him,” answered
his Uncle Dick. “I’d like to catch him red-handed
at something.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a scheme!” exclaimed Randy. “Jack,
you’d be the fellow to put it through because
you’re Uncle Dick’s son and it’s Uncle Dick that
Davenport is sore on.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” questioned his cousin.</p>

<p>“Lay a trap for Davenport by placing yourself
in such a position that he can get at you. Then,
when he thinks he’s got you, let the detectives
close in on him and make him a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Nothing like that!” came from Dick
Rover. “Davenport is too dangerous a fellow.
He might get away with his scheme, and Jack
would suffer. You can’t imagine how vindictive
that rascal is. Why, when he appeared at the
offices and made his demand for that money he
acted like the most cold-blooded villain you can
imagine. Sometimes I wonder if the loss of his
money down there in the oil fields hasn’t turned
his brain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“In that case we certainly had better look out,”
answered Fred. “Why, for all we know, he might
try to set fire to the houses or something of the
sort.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think he’ll try anything like that.
He is out for money, and to burn down these
houses wouldn’t give him any. Of course, he
might threaten to burn the places down, but that
wouldn’t get him anything, anyway, because we
have the places insured, and it would not be our
loss even though it might place us in personal peril
and cause us great inconvenience.”</p>

<p>“What do you really think he’ll try to do, Uncle
Dick?” asked Andy. And now for once the fun-loving
Rover boy was really sober.</p>

<p>“I think he’ll work his scheme in one of two
ways,” answered Dick Rover. “He’ll either try
to get at me in some business way—by threatening
The Rover Company with some tremendous
loss unless we come across as he wants me to—or
otherwise he’ll work his scheme either through
the girls or their mothers or through you boys.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he might try to carry some of
us off?” asked Fred bluntly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t it look like it when he tried to get
Martha and Mary into the auto?” questioned
Sam Rover.</p>

<p>“And what about that invitation my wife got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
that she paid no attention to?” put in Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“What was that?” queried several of the boys.</p>

<p>“You know your Aunt Nellie is quite interested
in basket work. This was an invitation to
attend an exhibition of such work to be given
by some Indians at a place uptown. Your Aunt
Nellie was urged to come by all means, and to
bring her sisters-in-law with her, and the letter
was signed in the name of one of her friends.
She did not go because her foot happened to hurt
her. Later, we found that the signature on the
invitation was forged, and a detective found out
that the exhibition of basket work was a fake.
The whole thing was gotten up to get your Aunt
Nellie and her sister and Aunt Dora to a rather
out-of-the-way place. What might have happened
if they had gone there, heaven only knows,” and
Tom Rover shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>This revelation was a surprise to the four boys,
and they hardly knew what to say concerning it.
It looked as if there had been a slick attempt
made to get the mother of the twins, and possibly
the mothers of the others, into the clutches of
Carson Davenport.</p>

<p>“I would like to lay my hands on that rascal
if he tried to do anything to my mother!” cried
Jack, his eyes flashing. “I would like to hammer
the daylights out of him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“I guess we’d all like to do that,” came from
Fred.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better stay at home instead of
going on any trip,” said Randy. “We might be
needed in case Davenport tried anything on the
girls or mother or the others.”</p>

<p>“No. We have talked the matter over, and
we have made another arrangement,” said Dick
Rover. He walked to the door, looked out into
the room beyond, and then closed the door carefully.
Then he walked to the windows, to see
that no one might be outside listening.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think we have to be very
careful,” he went on in a lower tone of voice.
“For all we know there may be a spy in the house.
We have two new servants, you know; and while
I think they are all right, we cannot afford at
this stage of the game to take any chances.”</p>

<p>“The idea is this,” said Tom Rover, as his
older brother paused. “You boys are to go out
West with me, keeping the matter as quiet as
possible. We won’t even let any one know the
exact time we’re going to start. When we go
Uncle Dick and Uncle Sam will look after the
girls and their mothers and your Aunt Nellie.”</p>

<p>“Will they stay here?” asked Fred rather
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. We have already arranged for a trip.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
They are going down the coast on a private yacht
owned by Stanley Browne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the gentleman who is a cousin
of Colonel Colby and who was your chum at
Brill College!” interrupted Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s the one. I communicated with Colonel
Colby, and when he was in New York last he
brought in Mr. Browne whom I had not seen
for a long time. Mr. Browne is taking the trip
for his health along with his wife and his daughter,
and they were very glad that the girls and
their mothers should accompany them. They
will also take Ruth along if her folks are willing.
No one will know the destination of the steam
yacht, so I think they will be safe until Davenport
is rounded up.”</p>

<p>“Say, this is certainly interesting!” was Andy’s
comment. “I don’t like the idea of running away
from such a fellow as Davenport. I’d rather go
after him.”</p>

<p>“We’d do that in a minute, Andy, if it wasn’t
for the girls and your mother and your aunts.
But as it is, we feel that we can’t afford to take
the chance. Davenport is a dangerous character,
and we have learned that he was mixed up in a
number of shady transactions in the West before
he landed in the oil fields. He isn’t above doing
desperate things when forced into a corner. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
it’s true that he and Tate and Jackson fixed up
their differences before they got out of prison.
And while Tate and Jackson may not have the
brains that Davenport has, still they are fellows
with plenty of backbone to put through any nefarious
scheme.”</p>

<p>After this there was a consultation lasting the
best part of an hour. The boys could plainly
see that their fathers would have gone after
Davenport and his pals without hesitation were
it not that they were afraid something would
be done to injure the other members of the Rover
families. They learned that a local detective
agency had been engaged to follow up Davenport
and his pals, but that so far little headway had
been made, showing that the rascal was keeping
well under cover.</p>

<p>It was decided the next day that Tom Rover
and the four boys should start on their Western
trip the following Monday. In the meantime
their mothers and the girls, including Ruth, who
obtained permission to go along, got ready for
the trip on the steam yacht and departed on
Wednesday. Without much ado all of the others
went down to the steam yacht which lay in the
North River and saw them off on the trip.</p>

<p>“Hope you have a good time,” said Jack, “and
no mishaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“You take care of yourself,” returned Ruth.
Then all in the party waved their hands until the
steam yacht was lost to view down the river.</p>

<p>Tom Rover was busy with his brothers fixing
up business matters previous to his departure for
the West, and he left it to the boys to buy the
necessary railroad tickets, including Pullman accommodations.
The father of the twins wished
to stay in Chicago for two days, and the passage
westward was to be arranged accordingly.</p>

<p>Having made so many trips before, the boys
knew exactly what they wanted to take along on
the present outing, so it did not take them long
to get their things together. Then, with little else
to do, they all set out that afternoon to purchase
the railroad accommodations desired. They left
the house in a bunch, going in one of the family
automobiles. The ticket office was down on
Broadway, and it did not take them long to reach
that place.</p>

<p>As they left the house they did not notice that
they were being watched by a young man on the
other side of Riverside Drive. This young man
followed the car to the nearest corner, and then
summoned a taxicab that was passing, leaped in,
and followed them.</p>

<p>“You can wait here for us, Peter,” said Jack
to the family chauffeur. “I don’t think we’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
very long,” and thereupon he and his cousins
started to enter the ticket agency.</p>

<p>As the four Rovers crossed the pavement in
the crowd a young man suddenly stepped up and
confronted them.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed cordially. “Am I mistaken,
or is this Jack Rover?”</p>

<p>“I’m Jack Rover, all right enough,” answered
the young major.</p>

<p>“And this is Fred, isn’t it?” went on the stranger,
smiling at the youngest member of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m Fred Rover,” was the reply. “But—but
I’m afraid you’ve got the best of me,” Fred
stammered. He thought the fellow’s face looked
a bit familiar, but he could not place him.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m Joe Brooks,” said the stranger.
“Don’t you remember? Fatty Hendry introduced
us one day when you were over at Haven Point—the
day of the big football game last year. I
was over there with Fatty and a fellow named
Ned Lowe, a great singer.”</p>

<p>“Are you the fellow who had the stiff neck
and was wearing a silk neckerchief?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve got my number,” answered Joe
Brooks. “What are you fellows doing down
here? I thought you were up at the military academy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“School has closed. And, anyway, we have
graduated,” answered Jack. He was trying
vainly to recall the stranger. The fellow’s face
looked familiar, but he could not remember having
ever spoken to him.</p>

<p>“Out for a day’s fun, I suppose,” said Brooks
easily. He acted as if he was in no hurry to leave
the Rovers. “How was Fatty the last you saw
of him?”</p>

<p>“Fine as silk,” answered Andy. “Taken on a
few pounds more,” and he grinned. He rather
liked the looks of the stranger.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get some railroad tickets,”
added Fred, and he nodded toward the agency.</p>

<p>“Why, that is just where I was going!” exclaimed
Joe Brooks. “I want to get accommodations
to Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going farther than that,” said
Randy, and thereupon all entered the ticket
agency.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>OFF FOR THE WEST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While the four Rover boys consulted with
one clerk in regard to Pullman accommodations,
first to Chicago and from there to Maporah, Joe
Brooks spoke to another clerk alongside regarding
accommodations to the first named city only.
The stranger seemed to hold the attention of the
clerk, asking numerous questions. But his eyes
and ears were wide open to take in all that the
Rovers were doing.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I like that train particularly,”
Andy heard Brooks remark to the second clerk
after their own business was concluded. “I traveled
on it once and the accommodations were
punk. I think I’ll ask one of my friends what
train he took. He said he had the finest accommodations
he had ever struck.”</p>

<p>With the railroad tickets and the sleeping car
coupons in an envelope in his pocket, Jack and
his cousins prepared to leave the agency. As they
did this, Joe Brooks turned to shake hands, smiling
as he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“I’m very glad to have met you,” he said.
“I’ll mention it to Fatty Hendry when I see him
this fall. I suppose you know Fatty has gone
up into Canada.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Hope you’ll have a nice trip when you do go
to Chicago,” put in Fred, who felt that he ought
to be nice to any friend of Fatty’s, who had always
been a good chum.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only a business trip. I sha’n’t be in
Chicago very long. I’ve got to come back to
Buffalo and then go to Toronto,” answered
Brooks, and then, bowing and smiling, he walked
off and disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>“It’s the funniest thing, but I can’t remember
that fellow at all,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“I remember the fellow who was at the football
game—the chap with the stiff neck,” said
Andy. “But, somehow, this fellow doesn’t look
exactly like he did. That fellow had more of a
round face.”</p>

<p>“Well, he seemed to know us all right enough—and
he certainly must know Fatty and Ned
Lowe,” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>All of the boys were in need of new caps, and
they became so interested in picking out the new
headgear that soon Joe Brooks was practically
forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>But the Rover boys would have been tremendously
interested had they seen the immediate
future actions of the fellow who had so unceremoniously
introduced himself to them. Walking
only a few blocks, Brooks entered a telegraph
office and wrote out the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">John Carson</span>,<br />

<p>“Four boys and Uncle Tom to Chicago morning of thirtieth.
Two days in Chicago, then on to Gold Hill Falls,
Maporah. Not recognized.</p>

<p>“There! I guess that will make Davenport get
busy,” murmured the young man as he handed
the message in. Then he paid for it and hurried
again out into the Broadway crowd.</p>

<p>With their mothers and the girls gone, the boys
found it rather lonely at the houses, and upon
Fred’s suggestion they had the chauffeur take
them down in the car to their fathers’ offices on
Wall Street.</p>

<p>“I think I’m going to get into the game with
dad some day,” remarked Jack, as they watched
what was going on. “Financial dealings seem to
suit me exactly.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather go into some profession,”
said Fred. “Law, or something like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing like that for me!” burst out Andy.
“I’d rather be a sailor or some kind of a traveler.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking, Andy!” returned his
twin. “When we get old enough let’s go around
the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d like a trip around the world myself,”
Fred put in quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you fellows went, you couldn’t leave
me behind,” remarked Jack. “But I guess we’re
a long way from going around the world just
yet. I think we can be thankful to get such trips
as we’re having.”</p>

<p>Since the time the offices had first been opened
the business of The Rover Company had steadily
increased. The company now employed eight
clerks, and the quarters had recently been doubled
in size. Dick, Tom and Sam had each an office
to himself, and there were likewise offices for the
bookkeepers and stenographers. In front there
was a handsome reception room where customers
might be received.</p>

<p>“Mighty spiffy, I’ll say,” declared Fred, as they
walked around. “I don’t believe there are any
nicer offices in the whole city.”</p>

<p>All the heads of the company were busy just
then, but presently the lads managed to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
twins’ father and told him of the railroad accommodations
they had purchased.</p>

<p>“Very good,” declared Tom Rover. “Just
what we need. I was afraid we might be disappointed
trying to get accommodations at such
short notice.”</p>

<p>To the boys, so impatient to start on the trip,
the time from then to Monday passed rather
slowly. They attended a couple of moving picture
shows and took a ride up to Bronx Park,
where they viewed the large collection of animals,
and went swimming at one of the city’s
large natatoriums. On Saturday afternoon they
attended a ball game at the Polo Grounds, rooting
strenuously for the Giants, who were playing
one of the teams from the West. On Sunday
they went to church in the morning and in the
afternoon the twins did what they could to help
their father in getting ready for the trip, since
Tom had little time to spare away from his desk
in Wall Street.</p>

<p>“Have you told anybody what train you were
going to take, or anything like that?” questioned
Tom Rover, when the last of the packing had
been done.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t told anybody that,” answered
Randy. Neither he nor the other boys suspected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
that the stranger who had introduced himself as
Joe Brooks had been spying on them.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that,” answered Tom
Rover. “Of course, it might not make any difference;
but, on the other hand, there is no use
in taking chances.”</p>

<p>At last came the hour for departure. Dick
Rover and his brother Sam saw the crowd off
at the Pennsylvania Station.</p>

<p>“Have the best time you can,” said Dick to
his son. “And don’t forget to write.”</p>

<p>“And you take care of yourself, Dad, and
don’t work too hard,” answered Jack. “Take a
day off now and then—it will do you good.”</p>

<p>“If you hear anything from that Carson Davenport,
let me know at once,” went on Dick to
Tom.</p>

<p>“I sure will!” answered the father of the twins.
“And if you hear anything, you must let us
know, too.”</p>

<p>“We will,” put in Sam Rover. And then it
was almost time for the train to depart, and the
five travelers clambered aboard.</p>

<p>The boys had reserved two whole sections, so
there was plenty of room for everybody and for
the hand baggage. They were soon out of the
tunnel and flying across the Jersey meadows on
the first stage of their trip westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“Uncle Tom, you promised to tell us the particulars
of what was taking you to the West,”
remarked Fred, who was curious to know the
details.</p>

<p>“It’s rather a long story, Fred,” answered his
uncle. “But I can give you a few of the main
facts if you’d like to hear them.”</p>

<p>All were more than anxious, and as the train
sped onward across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania
they all crowded into one section around
Tom Rover to hear what he might have to tell
them.</p>

<p>“I made my first investment in the Rolling
Thunder mine about two years ago,” began the
father of the twins. “It was recommended to me
by an old gold miner we met out West years ago,
a very reliable fellow. I put twenty-five thousand
dollars in the venture, and then followed it
with another twenty-five thousand dollars. Six
months ago I invested a third twenty-five thousand
dollars, making a total of seventy-five thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s quite a sum of money!” murmured
Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. And that’s why I am so anxious
to get out and see just what is going on,” said
his father. “When I made my first investment
the mine was doing very well, and it continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to do well after I made the second investment.
Then came something of a break, and the management
of the mine changed hands. I was told
that an assessment was in order, and as it looked
all right to me I put up the third twenty-five
thousand as I just remarked. Now there seems
to be another break and something or other has
gone wrong, although just what it is I cannot
imagine.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out that matters were going
wrong? Did they stop paying dividends?”
questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“No, they’ve not stopped paying dividends.
But I am of the opinion that the dividends are
being paid out of the surplus and not out of
earnings, as I have a right to expect. There is
an old miner out there, a fellow named Lew
Billings, a man I know well. Billings has sent
me three messages urging me to come on and
make an investigation. In his last message he
said he didn’t think it would do any good to
send an agent or a lawyer—that I had better come
myself, that there were some things he wanted
to explain to me personally.”</p>

<p>“That looks as though there might be some
crooked work there, doesn’t it?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. Lew Billings is an old-timer
and strictly honest, and he wouldn’t send such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
messages as he has unless he was confident that
something was wrong. He wanted me to hurry,
and that is why I am trying to get out there as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“But you’re going to stop off in Chicago!”
broke in Randy.</p>

<p>“I’m doing that, Son, because two other men
who are interested in that mine live in Chicago
and I want to interview both of them, if I can
get hold of them. It is just possible that they
may have gone on to Maporah ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“Are those two men your friends or do you
think they are working against you?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to think, Fred. I want
to have a talk with them first, then I’ll know
how they stand. If they are friendly, well and
good. But if they are on the other side, so to
speak, then I’ll have to fight my battle alone,”
answered Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“I certainly hope those men prove friendly to
you,” said Randy. “It will make matters so
much easier. It’s hard to fight a battle like that
all alone, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anybody at the mine outside
of this Lew Billings?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Not a soul, Son. They are all strangers to
me. There were half a dozen men I knew well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
when I made my first investment. But when
the change came those men either withdrew or
were forced out. If they were there now I
wouldn’t have much trouble. But as it is—well,
I suppose I’ll have to take things as they come,”
and Tom Rover heaved something of a sigh.
Evidently the trouble at the Rolling Thunder
mine was causing him a good deal of worry.</p>

<small>AN OLD FRIEND TURNS UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The boys passed a fairly comfortable night
on the train, even though it was rather warm.
They got up early in the morning, to find themselves
rolling swiftly along over the level fields
of the middle West.</p>

<p>“Where is Uncle Tom?” asked Fred when the
twins appeared.</p>

<p>“He’ll be out in a few minutes,” answered
Randy. “I don’t think he slept very well. I
heard him moving around quite a bit during the
night.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s worried about that mine,
Randy,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I think he’s got enough to worry about,”
put in Andy. “Seventy-five thousand dollars is a
lot of money.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” came from Fred. “Gee, I certainly
hope he finds everything all right when we
get out there!”</p>

<p>“I’m anxious to get out on Sunset Trail,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Jack. “That name certainly sounds interesting
to me. We ought to have the best times ever out
there.”</p>

<p>Lunch and dinner had been had on the train
the day before, and now as soon as Tom Rover
appeared the crowd entered the dining car for
breakfast.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have some cantaloupe to start
with,” said Fred. “That is, if——” He stopped
short and stared out of the window. The train
had rolled into the station of a fair-sized town
and come to a halt where a small crowd was
collected.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at, Fred?” questioned
Jack, as he noticed his cousin’s manner.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Fred. “See that man
with the big panama hat? Am I mistaken or
is that really Uncle Hans Mueller?”</p>

<p>Jack gave a quick look and so did the others,
including Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s Uncle Hans, all right enough!” exclaimed
Andy. He rapped on the window.
“Hello there!” he called out through the screen.
“Hello there, Uncle Hans!”</p>

<p>The man on the platform started and turned
around in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Hello there, Uncle Hans! Don’t you see us?”
broke in Fred, knocking on another window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“Py chimminy Christmas!” gasped Hans
Mueller, for it was really he. “If it don’t be dem
Rofer poys! What do you know apout dat!”</p>

<p>“Are you going to take this train?” questioned
Tom.</p>

<p>“Hello der, Dom! You der too, eh? Yes, I
was going to takes dis train by Chicago on. I
was waiting till dey start already. Dey got five
minutes here. But now I comes on board quick
right avay,” went on Hans Mueller, and then
disappeared in the direction of a spot where the
door to the steps of one of the vestibules of the
cars was open.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, Hans Mueller had
been a chum of the older Rovers when they had
attended Putnam Hall. He was of German extraction,
but during the World War had proven
his American patriotism in a marked degree.
After leaving school he had settled in Chicago,
and was now the owner of a chain of well-known
delicatessen stores. He was without family, and
had always insisted that the Rover boys and girls
call him uncle.</p>

<p>“I’m going after him and bring him in!” cried
Jack, and left the table as he spoke. He had
to walk through two cars, and then found the
delicatessen dealer approaching him. Hans
Mueller was grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Dis is de surbrize of mine life!” he exclaimed,
as he shook hands. “I was mighty glad to see
you. You go py Chicago, eh? Vell, I go der
too. You know dat is where my chain of stores
is.”</p>

<p>“Come on and have some breakfast with us,
Uncle Hans,” said Jack. “We’ll be real glad to
have your company.”</p>

<p>“Breakfast, eh? Why, I got breakfast t’ree
hours ago! But I come and have some coffee
mit you, anyhow. I can trink a couple of cubs
of coffee any time.”</p>

<p>The twins were sitting with their father, leaving
Fred and Jack at a table opposite. The others
greeted the newcomer cordially, and then Hans
Mueller sat down beside Fred.</p>

<p>“You must be my guests while you are py
Chicago in,” said the delicatessen dealer, when
they had explained the situation to him. “I got
patchelor quarters mit two extra bedrooms, and
I can get anudder bedroom by one of my neighbors.
I got a gut German cook, and I know you
been satisfied.”</p>

<p>“That will be very kind of you, Hans,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“Vat do you say, poys?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go, if it won’t be putting Uncle
Hans out too much,” said Randy readily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t put me oud,” said the delicatessen
dealer. “I vill stay in der house mit you.”</p>

<p>While the Rovers ate and the delicatessen dealer
sipped one cup of coffee after another, the former
gave a few of the details of what had brought
them on the trip.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go oud Vest mit you, but I can’t
do it,” said Hans Mueller. “I got to tend to my
chain of stores. Last veek I opened me a new
one, and next month I’m going to open anudder.
Dat vill make fourteen all told.”</p>

<p>“You must be getting rich, Uncle Hans,” remarked
Randy.</p>

<p>“Veil, I make enough py mine stores to keep
de mule from de window.”</p>

<p>“The mule from the window?” queried Fred,
in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Yes. You know vat I mean. Maybe he don’t
was a mule; maybe he was a lion. Anyway, he
was some kind of a wild animals.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you mean!” exclaimed Jack.
“You mean ‘keep the wolf from the door.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, dot’s him,” answered the delicatessen
dealer complacently.</p>

<p>The Rover boys were delighted to have Hans
Mueller with them, for they loved to hear him
talk. While a pupil at Putnam Hall Hans’s English
had not been of the best, and since he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
withdrawn to Chicago, and gone into the delicatessen
business, it had certainly not improved.</p>

<p>“I suppose he comes in contact with so many
foreigners his tongue gets all twisted up,” was
the way Jack explained it. “But he’s a dear old
Uncle Hans, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“Many is der time what I’d like to go py Putnam
Hall pack,” said Uncle Hans, with a mountainous
sigh. “But dat old school ain’t no more,
so I hear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right. Captain Putnam had to
retire on account of his age,” answered Tom.
“We certainly did have some great times there,
Hans.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dom, so we did. Do you remember dem
other fellows—dat Villiam Philander Dubbs, for
instance?”</p>

<p>“Do I remember William Philander Tubbs!”
cried Tom, mentioning a dudish youth who had
created considerable sport for him and his brothers.
“I’ll never forget him!”</p>

<p>“Do you know what Dubbs is doing now?”
went on Uncle Hans, his small eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Dot is a good joke, ha-ha!” roared Uncle
Hans. “Dot is de best joke what I know of!”</p>

<p>“What does this William Philander Tubbs do?”
questioned Jack eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“Vell, dot fellow vas de most redicular boy
whatever lived. His shoes vas patent leathers,
and his neckties alvays silks, and so loud dey
could almost talk. And he vas so clean! Oh,
you nefer saw a fellow what washed himself so
much and combed his hair so often. Vell, I don’t
t’ink he vas so clean now, nor so dudish either,
ha-ha!” exploded Uncle Hans. “T’ree years ago
Villiam Philander Dubbs’s uncle dies and he
leaves all his property to dot young man.”</p>

<p>“That was nice enough,” put in Randy.</p>

<p>“You t’ink so? You know what dat property
vas? Dat property vas a brickyard where dey
makes t’ousands and t’ousands of bricks.”</p>

<p>“A brickyard!” cried Tom, with a grin.
“Really?”</p>

<p>“Dot’s it, Dom. And now Villiam Philander
Dubbs he sells bricks, t’ousands and t’ousands of
’em. And not only dat, he goes down py de
yard and he sees dat dose bricks are made shust
right. Now, can you beat him?” and once again
Uncle Hans roared.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way it goes,” said Tom,
laughing also. “The fellow who would like to
become an artist runs a shoe factory, and the
fellow who would like to be a carpenter has a
music store willed to him.”</p>

<p>Hans Mueller had kept track of quite a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of the former pupils of Putnam Hall, and he
told Tom many interesting bits of news. In the
course of this talk he mentioned several jokes
that had been played and then turned to Andy
and Randy.</p>

<p>“You must not t’ink dot your fader was alvays
so meek like a donkey,” he said, closing one eye
suggestively. “Your fader could play more jokes
like a dog could scratch fleas.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, Hans! You mustn’t give me
away like that,” remonstrated Tom. “The boys
will get the idea that I was a regular cut-up.”</p>

<p>“A cut-up! Ha-ha! You was worse like a
t’ousand cut-ups, Dom Rover!” laughed the delicatessen
dealer. “Ven dose poys cut up, it ain’t
to be wondered at, because dey vas slices from der
old stump.”</p>

<p>“Wow-wow!” exploded Randy. “Slices of the
old stump! Did you get that, Andy?”</p>

<p>“I sure did!” was the ready reply. “It knocks
‘chips of the old block’ silly, doesn’t it?” and then
all the boys began to laugh.</p>

<p>The boys were so interested talking to Uncle
Hans that almost before they knew it the train
rolled into the big Union Station in Chicago and
they had to alight. Hans Mueller rushed off
to engage a couple of taxicabs, and in a few
minutes more they were on their way to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
bachelor quarters which were on a pleasant side
street and not so very far distant.</p>

<p>“I like to live close py mine main stores,” explained
Hans Mueller. “Den if anyt’ing goes
wrong, I can pe right on de spot quick.”</p>

<p>Even though he was in the heart of Chicago,
his quarters were exceedingly comfortable, and
the boys speedily made themselves at home. Then
Tom Rover went off to interview the two men
who were interested in the Rolling Thunder mine.</p>

<p>“I got to go to pusiness now,” said Hans
Mueller. “What would you poys like to do?”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll just take a look around,” said
Jack. “We won’t bother you any more for the
present.”</p>

<p>“Vell, you be here in time for supper at six
o’clock,” said the delicatessen dealer, and so it
was arranged. Then the boys sallied forth to
look around the big city of the lakes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>A PLOT AGAINST THE ROVERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That afternoon the four Rover boys visited
a number of points of interest in Chicago and
even took a run out to the famous stock yards,
Hans Mueller having given them a card to an
official located there. Through this man they
were enabled to see many interesting details of
how large quantities of meat are prepared for
consumption.</p>

<p>“It’s all right enough,” remarked Andy when
they were returning to the delicatessen dealer’s
apartment. “But, just the same, excuse me from
working in or around any stock yard.”</p>

<p>“The same here,” answered Fred readily. “If
they had to depend on me to kill their cattle or
dress it, I am sure we would have to go without
meat.”</p>

<p>That evening the boys learned that Tom Rover
had had an interesting session with one of the
stockholders in the Rolling Thunder mine. He
was to meet another one of the owners on the
following morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t say that things look very good,” said
the twins’ father, in reply to a question from
Jack. “There’s a crowd at the mine that is evidently
bent on pushing some of the stockholders,
including myself, to the wall.”</p>

<p>“But how can they do that, Uncle Tom?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“They’ve been depressing the value of the stock
on the market as much as possible,” answered his
Uncle Tom. “Now they have virtually got control
of the actual working of the mine and are
doing things out at Gold Hill Falls to suit themselves.
I think it is high time that I got on the
ground to protect my rights.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s de vay to do it,” came from Hans
Mueller. “It’s all right enough to write letters
and talk by de telephone over to a man, but if
you want to do real pusiness go and talk mit him
face by face.”</p>

<p>Hans Mueller was quite anxious that all of
the Rovers should see the factory, or works,
which he ran in connection with his chain of
delicatessen stores. Tom could not spare the time
to go, but the boys were willing, and so set
off on the following morning early.</p>

<p>The works was one where Hans Mueller turned
out his sauerkraut, pickles, and numerous table
delicacies. Here they handled many hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of pounds of frankfurters, bolognas, and numerous
kinds of smoked and salted fish and meats.</p>

<p>“Mine sauerkraut has taken already six brizes,”
said the delicatessen dealer proudly. “And nobody
in all Chicago has any better hot dogs,
as you call ’em, dan I carry. And den mine
cheeses! Why, I import cheeses from all over
de world! I can show you cheeses what you
never even heard de name of,” he went on earnestly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet the smell of some of them would
knock a house down,” added Andy.</p>

<p>“Vell, a smell is already something what you
got to get used to,” answered Hans Mueller
philosophically.</p>

<p>The lads had lunch with the delicatessen dealer
at a cafeteria restaurant run in connection with
his largest store. They had chicken salad and
tongue sandwiches, along with “home-made”
apple pie, all of which the boys relished keenly.</p>

<p>“It’s as good a lunch as a fellow could get
at a leading hotel,” declared Jack to their host.
“No wonder your stores are a big success, Uncle
Hans.”</p>

<p>“Vell, I tries to give de bublic der money’s
worth,” was the reply.</p>

<p>After lunch Hans Mueller had to go off to visit
some of his other stores, and the boys started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
out on another inspection of the big city by the
lakes.</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal like New York, only somewhat
different,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“That certainly is a queer way to put it,” returned
Fred, with a grin. “How can it be the
same if it’s different?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’s like a ball game I saw some
time ago,” said Andy dryly. “It was nine to nine
in the first inning, and only three to five in the
last inning.”</p>

<p>“Nine to nine in the first inning and three to
five in the last!” cried Fred in perplexity. “What
are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Well, it was this way: There were nine players
on each side in the first inning, and they
started——” And thereupon Andy dodged
quickly behind a signboard as Fred made as if to
attack him while the others laughed.</p>

<p>The four boys were walking along in the vicinity
of the Union Station when they saw somebody
coming toward them. It was the young
man they had met while going for railroad tickets
in New York.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” cried Joe Brooks, smiling.
“You said you were coming to Chicago,
but I certainly didn’t expect to fall in with you
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“Did you just get in?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Got in a few hours ago. How are you enjoying
yourselves in the Windy City?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re getting along all right enough,”
answered Jack. “We have been around town
quite a bit, and also out to the stock yards.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t staying in Chicago very long, I
take it,” went on Joe Brooks.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave to-morrow morning,” answered
Randy.</p>

<p>Thereupon Joe Brooks started to tell them a
somewhat lengthy story of what had brought him
to Chicago. He said that he was traveling for
a crockery house and hoped to catch one of his
customers that afternoon.</p>

<p>“It’s a rich concern and I’m hoping to land a
big order, but I’ve got to wait till five o’clock
before I can see my man,” he went on. “So I’ve
got quite a little time on my hands. What are
you fellows doing? I might go along if you don’t
mind,” and he smiled genially.</p>

<p>“We’re not doing much of anything,” answered
Jack politely.</p>

<p>“Want me to show you around a little? I’ll
be glad to do it. I’d do almost anything for
friends of Fatty Hendry. He and his relatives
have always treated me fine.”</p>

<p>Joe Brooks was a slick talker and before long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
he was walking with the four Rover boys, pointing
out various places of interest and also pointing
out different people as they passed either on
foot or in automobiles.</p>

<p>“There’s the mayor of this burg,” he declared
as an auto flashed past. “Great fellow he is, too.
I had the pleasure of meeting him once when
I was here at a trade dinner. And that man
walking on the other side of the street over there
is at the head of the schools here. A great man.
I understand he has made a small fortune out
of spelling books.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” answered Andy. “Well, I don’t
think I’ll ever make a fortune out of spelling
books,” and he grinned.</p>

<p>In the most casual manner possible Joe Brooks
drew the boys out until he got many of the particulars
from them concerning their proposed trip
to Gold Hill Falls and Sunset Trail. Now that
they were so far on their trip, they did not consider
it necessary to be as secretive about it as
before. Never for one minute did they suspect
that this young man knew Carson Davenport
or had anything to do with that scoundrel.</p>

<p>“You fellows ought to have the time of your
lives out there around Maporah,” said Brooks.
“Gee, I wish I could go along! I’m sure it would
beat selling crockery all to pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly hope to have a splendid outing,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you have earned it. It’s hard
work to graduate from any school, and I suppose
your studies were pretty stiff at that military
academy you and Fatty attended.”</p>

<p>“They were certainly stiff enough,” answered
Randy.</p>

<p>“Going to be out there long?”</p>

<p>“A month at least, and maybe six or seven
weeks,” answered Fred. “We hope to have some
good fishing, and maybe a little hunting too.”</p>

<p>At half past four Joe Brooks excused himself,
stating that he would have to hunt up his customer
before the man had a chance to get away
from him. He shook hands all around and again
wished the Rovers the best of luck.</p>

<p>“He’s a pretty good sort, seems to me,” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“He certainly acted nice enough,” answered
Andy.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did,” added his twin.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing. For some reason he could
not fathom, the strange young man had not altogether
appealed to him. Yet, what there was
about Joe Brooks he did not like was something
he could not put into words.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour after Joe Brooks had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
left the Rover boys he entered a hotel in one of
the shabby sections of Chicago. Here he fell in
with Carson Davenport and a few minutes later
the pair were joined by two other men.</p>

<p>“Well, did you find out anything more?” questioned
the man from the oil fields.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve found out everything we want
to know,” answered Joe Brooks.</p>

<p>“Then you found out where they’re stopping?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t have to. I ran right into the four boys
on the street.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly were lucky!”</p>

<p>“I hung around the station for three hours before
that,” answered Brooks. “At first I thought
I’d call up the leading hotels by telephone; but
I was afraid that might look suspicious. So then
I thought I’d go out and take a look around. I
didn’t expect to see them, and I only thought
I could fill in time until to-morrow morning,
when they were to take that train for which they
bought accommodations in New York. I thought
maybe I could have a chance to talk to them
before they left and get a few particulars. But
now I think I’ve got everything we need.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go upstairs and talk it over,” said Carson
Davenport. “No use of letting anybody else
in on this. There are too many open ears around
down here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Thereupon the four men took a rickety elevator
to the fourth floor of the hotel. They entered
one of the rooms they had engaged and all
sat down to hear what Brooks had to say.</p>

<p>“They’re going straight to Maporah first,” said
the young man. “From there they are to take
horses to Gold Hill Falls. After that the boys
expect to have a good time on Sunset Trail.
They did not know exactly where they would
stay, but thought it would be in some place engaged
by a miner named Lew Billings.”</p>

<p>“Lew Billings!” exclaimed one of the other
men. “I know him, all right enough!”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the foremen at the Rolling Thunder
mine, isn’t he, Tate?” questioned Davenport.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tate.</p>

<p>“We know all about Sunset Trail,” put in the
other man of the party. “Tate and I have gone
over it many a time.”</p>

<p>“Well, that ought to help a whole lot, Jackson,”
returned Davenport, with satisfaction. “It’s just
the place to put through a deal like we have in
mind, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” answered Jackson. “Couldn’t
be better. Let us once lay our hands on those
kids, and I’ll defy anybody to get ’em away from
us.”</p>

<p>“The main thing is to keep out of their sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
until our trap is sprung,” went on Carson Davenport.
“We mustn’t let them know what we’re
doing. But once let me get my hands on those
boys, and I’ll guarantee that I’ll make their fathers
pony up good and plenty,” he added, his eyes
gleaming wickedly.</p>

<small>FOUR BOYS AND A BULL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the Rover boys returned to Hans
Mueller’s house they found the twins’ father hard
at work over a mass of papers.</p>

<p>“I saw that other stockholder,” said Tom
Rover, in explanation. “He is as much mystified
as to what is taking place at the Rolling Thunder
mine as I am. He’ll follow us out there just
as soon as he can arrange certain business affairs
here. He’s with me in everything, and is going
to help me bring those other fellows up with a
round turn.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that this whole business had to
get into such a mix, Uncle Tom,” declared Fred.</p>

<p>“For all I know, I may have to call on you
boys to help me,” answered the twins’ father.
“From what Brother Dick told me, you did very
well in the oil fields, and you may have a chance
to show your mettle out in the gold fields.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m ready to help you all I can, Uncle
Tom,” cried Jack quickly. “I’ll do anything you
say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“The fun of the outing can wait,” declared
Fred.</p>

<p>“Sure, it can wait, Dad!” cried Randy. “You
just give the orders, and we’ll fill ’em.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind running a gold mine for a
day or two,” grinned Andy. “It might give me
a chance to fill my pockets with nuggets.”</p>

<p>“I want to warn you boys to be careful of what
you say and what you do when we get to the
mining region,” answered Tom Rover. “Some
of the men out there are desperate characters and
some are very touchy. You say the wrong thing
to a touchy man and he may pull a gun on you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know enough to watch out,” answered
Jack. “Just the same, Uncle Tom, if we fellows
can help you in any way, don’t you hesitate to
call on us.”</p>

<p>Early the following morning the Rovers bade
farewell to Hans Mueller, who had them taken
to the railroad station.</p>

<p>“If I could only get avay already, I’d go mit
you in a minute,” declared the genial delicatessen
dealer. “I haf not forgot what a good time I
haf ven I go to Big Horn Ranch dat time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what a dandy outing we did have,
every one of us,” declared Randy.</p>

<p>Soon the Rovers were aboard the train bound
westward. As before, they had a double section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
and proceeded to make themselves as much at
home as possible.</p>

<p>As the hours went by Tom Rover gave the
boys some of the particulars regarding his interview
with the mine’s stockholders.</p>

<p>“There is a fellow at the mine named Garrish—Peter
Garrish—who is now in charge. He’s a
promoter from Canada and an unusually slick
individual. From what I can make out, Garrish
is going to do his best to squeeze us out and put
himself and his friends in complete possession
of the Rolling Thunder mine.”</p>

<p>“But you say you have your representative
there—this old miner named Lew Billings,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“So I have, Jack. But the trouble is, while
Billings is a first-class mining operator, he is
rather deficient in education and knows little about
the legal aspects of affairs. On the other hand,
Garrish was at one time a lawyer and evidently
knows the mining game from a legal standpoint
in all its details. For all I know, when it came
to legal matters he might be able to twist Billings
around his finger.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would have been a good thing,
Dad, if you had brought a lawyer along,” suggested
Randy.</p>

<p>“Before I left Chicago I had an interview with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
a lawyer who is affiliated with our attorneys in
New York. I arranged matters with him so that
if he is needed he’ll come on immediately to represent
me.”</p>

<p>As the boys had traveled westward before, the
trip was no great novelty. Yet there were many
interesting sights along the way, and they did
not tire of looking out of the windows or of
spending hour after hour on the observation platform
of the last car.</p>

<p>“These open spaces are what get me,” declared
Randy, stretching out his arm in a semicircle.
“Just look at the thousands and thousands of
acres of land that seem to be going to waste!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then think of the thousands and
thousands of people who are huddling in the tenements
of all of the big cities,” returned Jack.
“It seems all wrong, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose a lot of those people want
companionship,” came from Fred. “And they
wouldn’t get much of it if they were spread all
around this scenery.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll ever want to settle down
in the heart of a big city,” said Andy thoughtfully.
“Where we live isn’t so bad. We’ve got
plenty of air and a nice view of the Hudson
River. But, just the same, I’d rather rove around
the open places. When I get down in one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
those narrow streets in lower New York, with
the monstrous buildings on both sides, I always
feel shut in, just as if the whole thing was going
to tumble down on top of me.”</p>

<p>“You’d rather have a bungalow on the top of
Pike’s Peak, wouldn’t you, Andy?” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Although I think I’d prefer a bird’s
nest on the top of the north pole,” answered the
fun-loving boy, with a grin.</p>

<p>The first day on the train passed without special
incident. The boys slept well, and the twins
were glad to note that their father did likewise.</p>

<p>“I guess dad is glad that Mr. Renton is going
to act with him. You know he represents a sixty-thousand-dollar
interest, and that is a good deal,”
said Randy. Mr. Renton was the second stockholder
Tom Rover had called upon in Chicago.</p>

<p>At noon on the second day, which was the
Fourth of July, came something of an interruption.
The whole party were at lunch in the dining
car when there came such a sudden halt that their
coffee was splashed all over the table.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Andy. “Good-by, green
corn!” he added, for an ear of corn had rolled
from his plate to the aisle of the car.</p>

<p>“We certainly stopped in a hurry,” declared
Fred. “I wonder what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a celebration,” suggested Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>The boys and Tom Rover finished their meal
and then walked back to the car where their sections
were located. They found that a number
of the passengers had left the train, and from
one of these learned that there was trouble on a
bridge just ahead.</p>

<p>“A freight that was crossing left the tracks,
and they say it will take an hour or more to clear
up the muss,” explained one of the passengers.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up ahead and take a look at things,”
said Jack. “I’ll be glad to stretch my legs.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll go,” returned Tom Rover.
“While the train is standing still I think I’ll try
to catch a nap. You boys can go if you want to.
But keep out of trouble and don’t get left when
the train starts again.”</p>

<p>The spot was one where the road crossed a
small stream. Along this watercourse there was
a fringe of trees and brushwood. The land was
comparatively level and covered with sage and
prairie grass.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd of people were collected at the
front of the train, and the boys soon saw what
the trouble was. Two freight cars were off the
track and resting in just such a position that the
other train could not get by.</p>

<p>“They’ve sent for a wrecking crew and think
they’ll be here inside of half an hour,” said one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of the men, in answer to the boys’ questions. “It
won’t take them very long to straighten matters
out when once they get at work.”</p>

<p>Having viewed the wreck for several minutes,
the boys saw a footpath leading along the stream,
and Andy suggested that they take a short walk
in that direction.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what state we’ll be walking in,”
said the fun-loving Rover. “But it will certainly
be a state that suits me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we might do, Andy,” suggested
his brother, with a twinkle in his eye.
“You were saying something this morning about
missing your bath. What’s the matter with going
in swimming here?”</p>

<p>“Gee, that would be an idea!” was the ready
response. “Let’s do it!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” ordered Jack. “You don’t
know a thing about that stream in the first place.
And in the second, how would you feel if you
were in the water and suddenly heard the train
whistle to go ahead?”</p>

<p>“I’d grab up my clothing and run,” answered
Andy.</p>

<p>“Maybe you would and maybe you wouldn’t,”
declared Fred. “I’d like a swim myself. But I
really don’t think we ought to risk it,” he added.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant walking along the footpath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
bordering the river, and the boys found
several spots which in the past had evidently been
used for camping. They had vaulted a low fence,
satisfied that no one would interfere with their
walk.</p>

<p>“Not a house in sight,” declared Jack, looking
around. “And yet we passed a fair-sized town
just when we started to go to lunch.”</p>

<p>“This is some sort of a ranch, I take it,” returned
Fred. “Aren’t those cows further up the
river?”</p>

<p>“Sure they’re cows!” declared Randy. “And
a pretty big herd of ’em, too.”</p>

<p>“I understand cattle on the hoof is worth a
good deal of money these days,” went on Jack.
“I’d like to own a few thousand cattle.”</p>

<p>“It must be a lot of fun rounding them up,”
declared Andy.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so much fun though if the cattle try
to round you up,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>The boys walked on a little farther and then
concluded that it would be best to return to the
train. They had just started to retrace their
steps when they heard a crashing in the brushwood
behind them. “Hello! who’s coming?”
cried Fred.</p>

<p>“He must be in a tremendous hurry by the noise
he’s making,” came from Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Sounds to me like one of those cows,” announced
Jack.</p>

<p>The sounds kept coming closer and presently
through an opening in the brushwood behind
them the four boys saw a large beast come into
view.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a cow—it’s a bull!” exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he doesn’t look to be any too
friendly,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t like this,” said Andy. “Looks
to me as if that beast might come for us.”</p>

<p>The boys continued on their way in the direction
of the train and the bull came after them.
At first the beast eyed them with more curiosity
than anger. But presently he gave a bellow and
started to charge toward them.</p>

<p>“Look out! He’s coming for us!” yelled Jack.
“Run for it, everybody!”</p>

<p>No one needed any urging, and the four boys
hurried down the footpath as fast as they could
go. The sudden flight of the lads seemed to take
the bull by surprise. His first charge came to a
sudden halt. Then, however, he let out another
bellow and came after them swifter than ever.</p>

<small>A NARROW ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Run! Run!”</p>

<p>“He’s right behind us!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better jump into the river!”</p>

<p>“Get behind the bushes,” suggested Jack. “He
can’t get through as quickly as we can! He’ll
get himself all tangled up!”</p>

<p>One after another the Rover boys left the footpath
and plunged into the brushwood leading
down to the stream. Then they came to a clump
of trees, several branches of which swung low,
and Randy, who was in advance, pulled himself
up. The others, seeing the move, followed. On
and on came the bull, crashing through the brushwood
with scarcely an effort. Then, just as the
last of the four lads had pulled himself up into
one of the trees, <a href="#i_fp170">the enraged beast</a> gave a bellow
and a snort and <a href="#i_fp170">came to a stop just beneath them</a>.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_171">THE ENRAGED BEAST CAME TO A STOP BENEATH THEM.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Gee, but that was a narrow escape!” gasped
Randy, when he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world it was,” panted Fred.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
“Gosh! did you ever see such a savage beast?”</p>

<p>“He was certainly willing to horn all of us,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s still willing,” came from Andy
as he looked downward. “Hi! Get out of
there!” he yelled, shaking his fist at the bull.
But this only made the beast bellow louder than
ever. He switched his tail and shook his head
from side to side and then glared viciously at
the four boys.</p>

<p>“We’re in a pickle, if you ask me,” declared
Fred, after a pause during which the boys tried
to regain their breath. “If that bull doesn’t go
away, how are we going to get back to the
train?”</p>

<p>“Is that a question or a riddle?” queried Andy.
“If it’s a riddle, I give it up. This is sure a
new sort of Fourth of July celebration.”</p>

<p>“If we only had a few rocks to throw at the
bull perhaps we could chase him away,” suggested
Fred.</p>

<p>“Not that bull!” answered Jack. “He’s a real
dyed-in-the-wool monarch of the pasture. Just
look at him! Why, he looks as if he was thinking
he might butt down the tree and get at us
that way!”</p>

<p>The boys were certainly in a quandary. They
had not only to act, but to act quickly. Any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
moment they expected to hear the whistle of the
train preparatory to continuing the journey westward.</p>

<p>“We’ll be in a fine pickle if that train goes
off,” groaned Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and what will dad think when he finds
us missing?” added his twin.</p>

<p>The tree the boys had climbed was a short,
stocky affair, and some of its branches intertwined
with those of another tree standing directly
on the bank of the stream along which
the lads had been walking.</p>

<p>“Come on! I think I see a way out of this!”
cried Jack. “Anyway, it won’t hurt to try it!”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?” questioned Fred
quickly.</p>

<p>“See that big tree? It leans right over the river
and some of the branches touch one of the trees
on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s the thing to do!” burst out
Randy. “I don’t believe that bull will follow us
across the stream.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so myself. Anyway, we can try
getting over. We won’t be any worse off on that
side of the water than we are on this.”</p>

<p>Jack led the way with all possible speed, and
one after another his cousins followed him. It
was not difficult to get into the next tree; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
climbing out on the sloping trunk and then out
on the limbs which brushed those from the tree
on the other side of the stream was not so easy.
Jack made the first swing and Andy followed.
Then came the other twin.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Fred!” yelled Jack, as he saw his
cousin swing downward.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when there was a crack
of wood as the limb upon which the youngest
Rover had depended snapped. But Fred swung
himself outward and then caught tight hold of a
limb below those upon which the others rested.</p>

<p>“Safe?” queried Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so!” panted Fred. “Gee, but that
was a close shave!”</p>

<p>“Listen!” called out Andy suddenly. “Isn’t
that the locomotive whistle?”</p>

<p>All stopped short. They heard the bellow of
the bull that had been left behind them, and
then, loud and clear, came the whistle from the
locomotive near the bridge.</p>

<p>“They’re going to leave us behind!” groaned
Fred.</p>

<p>“Come on—all of you!” yelled Jack. “I’ll go
ahead and see if I can’t stop the train some way.”</p>

<p>When looking at the wreck the oldest of the
Rover boys had noticed that after leaving the
bridge the track curved slightly northward in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the direction in which they had been walking.
Now, forgetting the bull entirely, Jack clambered
to the trunk of the tree, slid down, and rushed
through the brushwood and then out across the
field beyond to where he could see the distant
tracks and telegraph poles.</p>

<p>“I hope he makes it!” cried Andy, as he followed
his cousin to the ground.</p>

<p>“Look! Look! I think the bull is coming
after us, after all!” yelled his twin.</p>

<p>One after another the boys reached the ground.
They glanced back, to see that the bull had come
down to the edge of the stream and had even
waded in up to his knees. But evidently the footing
did not please him, and there he remained,
bellowing his defiance.</p>

<p>Jack had been in many cross-country runs and
athletic contests, but never had he sprinted faster
than now. Over the prairie and through the
sage brush he tore, heading for the nearest point
on the railroad. As he went he pulled out his
handkerchief and waved it wildly, yelling as he
did so.</p>

<p>The wreckage had been moved sufficiently to
allow the limited to pass, but the margin of
safety was narrow, and the long line of Pullmans
had to proceed slowly. In the meantime
the whistle and the bell were kept going, so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the track might be kept clear of the wrecking
crew and any men who might be around belonging
to the freight train.</p>

<p>At last Jack was less than a hundred yards
from the track. The train had been coming
slowly, but now, as the wreck was left behind,
the engineer increased the speed. Then Jack
bounded on the track, took off his coat and waved
it wildly.</p>

<p>On and on came the train. Would it stop?
Jack was almost afraid his signal would not be
heeded, for the great locomotive glided past him,
thundering loudly. Then the brakes were applied,
and with a jerk the long train slowed up.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! She’s stopped!” came from Fred,
and in a few seconds more the three Rover boys
came up alongside of the young major.</p>

<p>As soon as the train halted the conductor had
a porter open one of the vestibule doors so that
he might ascertain the cause of the new delay.
The train official saw the boys and could not help
but grin as they came up to him all out of breath.</p>

<p>“Almost got left, eh?” he said genially. “Well,
it might have served you right. You had no
business to leave the train.”</p>

<p>“Are you all there?” came a voice from over
the conductor’s shoulder, and Tom Rover appeared,
his face full of anxiety. “I’ve been looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
all over for you. I thought you might be
on some other part of the train.”</p>

<p>“We’re all here safe and sound, Dad,” answered
Randy. “But we’ve had one experience,
believe me!”</p>

<p>“What kind of an experience?” questioned the
conductor. And then he added quickly: “Any
more to come aboard?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“All right then, we’ll go ahead,” and the vestibule
door was closed again and the long train
proceeded on its way.</p>

<p>Not only Tom Rover and the conductor but
the porter and a number of passengers listened
with interest to the story the boys had to tell.
Quite a few laughed when they related how the
bull had wanted to horn them.</p>

<p>“You were lucky to get off so easily,” said
Tom Rover. “And doubly lucky that you weren’t
left behind.”</p>

<p>“It was clever to think of crossing the stream
from tree to tree,” commented the conductor.
“Bright idea! Of course, the bull might have
waded over, but that would have taken time.”</p>

<p>The boys went back to their sections and were
content for the rest of that Fourth of July to
take it easy.</p>

<p>“Well, we had a touch of Western life right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
at the start,” remarked Randy. “I suppose we’ve
got to look for all sorts of things to happen when
we get out on Sunset Trail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think the West is as wild
as all that,” answered Tom Rover. “Most of
the wild things that are happening to-day are in
the movies. You may find things no more exciting
at Gold Hill Falls than in any coal-mining
town in Virginia or Pennsylvania. With the
coming of men to those places, the wild animals
have taken themselves to the tall timber.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t spoil the outing, Uncle Tom!” cried
Fred. “Why, we expect to see bears and mountain
lions and everything like that before we go
back!”</p>

<p>“All right then, Fred, go to it,” laughed his
uncle. “Only don’t let the bears and mountain
lions see you first.”</p>

<p>By noon of the next day they had left the
prairies behind and were slowly but surely climbing
the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Now
the character of the scenery changed, and the
boys were gradually impressed with the beauties
of nature as unfolded to their vision.</p>

<p>“Here’s a regular scene for a painter,” said
Jack presently, and he pointed down into a deep
valley where a river wound its way among numerous
bowlders. There was a small stretch of pasture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
land on one side of the stream, and beyond
was a mountain covered with timber of various
kinds.</p>

<p>It was at the next stop, reached about an hour
later, that the Rover boys caught their first sight
of Indians. There was a reservation not a great
distance away, and a number of the redmen,
along with their squaws, had come down to the
station to sell trinkets and to obtain tips for
allowing their photographs to be taken.</p>

<p>“That’s one way of getting into the pictures,”
remarked Jack. “That old Indian yonder said I
could take his photograph shaking hands with
you other fellows for fifty cents apiece. What
do you know about that!”</p>

<p>“The old Indians don’t change much,” answered
Tom Rover. “They are out for any money they
can get. Just the same, that old Indian may have
a son at college or on one of the big baseball
teams.”</p>

<p>“I knew one of the Indian ball players,” said
Fred proudly. “His name was Big Knee, but
they called him Joe Smith. He was a twirler
for a middle West team.”</p>

<p>It lacked but an hour to sunset when they
arrived at Maporah. The boys had expected to
see quite a town, and were somewhat disappointed
when they saw only a dingy little station,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
a store and post-office combined, and half a dozen
tumbled-down dwellings.</p>

<p>“Hardly anybody lives around here,” explained
Tom Rover. “It used to be quite a center when
the gold mines behind the town were in operation.
But as soon as they failed to pay, the town practically
went broke. But it’s the nearest station
to Gold Hill Falls.”</p>

<p>Several days before Tom Rover had sent a
telegraph to Lew Billings, asking that individual
to be on hand at the station with saddle horses
or some conveyance to take the whole party over
to Sunset Trail. He was therefore much disappointed
when on alighting from the train with
the boys he saw nothing of the man from the
mine.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand this,” he said, after a look
around. “He certainly should have received my
message.”</p>

<p>There was only a handful of men around the
little station, and no one but the Rovers had
left the train. While Tom Rover was deliberating
on what to do next a strange man, a miner
wearing a flannel shirt, broad-brimmed hat, and
with his trousers tucked in his boots, strode up
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Rover?” he asked in rather a
low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“I am,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“My name is Butts—Hank Butts. I work over
at the Rolling Thunder mine.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then, Butts, perhaps you can tell
me where Lew Billings is?”</p>

<p>For reply, and greatly to Tom Rover’s astonishment,
the miner leaned forward and whispered
hoarsely:</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you that, partner. Lew disappeared
two days ago, and nobody seems to know what’s
become of him.”</p>

<small>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LEW BILLINGS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Lew Billings has disappeared!” exclaimed
Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“Yes, partner. Teetotally and completely vamoosed,
and nobody knows where to,” answered
the strange miner.</p>

<p>“Do you think he has been the victim of foul
play?” went on the father of the twins, his face
showing his concern.</p>

<p>“I can’t say as to that. He left between two
days, as the saying goes. Nobody saw him go.
That is, if they did see him they haven’t mentioned
it,” corrected Hank Butts.</p>

<p>“Did you come here to tell me this?”</p>

<p>“I did. You see, Lew and me have been partners
for a good many years. We went up to
the Klondike together, and we also staked out
the Blue Daisy claim. Me and Lew was just
like brothers. He told me a little about what
you expected to do when you got here, and told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
me about when he expected you to arrive. That’s
the reason I’ve been on the lookout for you.”</p>

<p>“Did you say you’ve been working with
Billings?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. You know the mine is divided
into two veins, the north and the south. Lew
always had charge up at the north end while I
work under a man named Haggerty at the south
end. But we got together quite often, just for
the sake of old times,” went on Hank Butts.</p>

<p>The boys listened with much interest to this
conversation and continued to listen when Butts
explained more in detail concerning the mysterious
disappearance of Lew Billings. He said that
Billings and the manager at the mine, Peter Garrish,
had had a hot discussion over certain matters
concerning the way the work was being carried
on in the north vein, and he was afraid Billings
had said too much.</p>

<p>“He mentioned you, Mr. Rover, and also a
Chicago capitalist named Renton, and that seemed
to make Garrish wild. I understand the two had
it hot and heavy for quite a while, and then
Billings went away in disgust.”</p>

<p>“Was that the night he disappeared?” asked
Jack. Tom Rover had explained to the miner
that the boys were his two sons and his two
nephews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it. Garrish and Lew had their argument
about five o’clock. Then Lew went down
to the bunkhouse, and a little later had his supper.
After that he got some kind of a message and
went up the mountainside where they had reported
some kind of a landslide a few days before.
That was the last seen of Lew by any one of our
men.”</p>

<p>“Gee! you don’t suppose he was swallowed up
by the landslide?” exclaimed Randy.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t no landslide when Lew went
there. That happened several days before. Besides,
me and some other men searched the whole
vicinity and didn’t find no trace of Lew.”</p>

<p>“But he might have been caught in a new slide
and buried out of sight,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“It’s possible, my lad. But I don’t think so.
Lew Billings was a very careful man, and he
wouldn’t go prowling around no loose dirt or
rocks unless he knew what he was doing. In
all the years he’s been mining and prospecting,
I never knew him to get caught in any such way as
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your idea, Butts? Give it to me
straight,” came sharply from Tom Rover.
“We’re both friends of Lew Billings, so there is
no use in beating about the bush.”</p>

<p>“Well, it ain’t for me to say what happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to Lew,” returned the old miner doggedly. “I
told you about the argument he had with Peter
Garrish. Maybe that had something to do with
it, and maybe it didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, Lew Billings is my friend and Peter
Garrish is not,” answered Tom Rover bluntly.
“This looks like some sort of foul play to
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad, you don’t think they would——”
Andy broke off short, hardly daring to go on.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think, Andy,” was his
father’s sober reply. “This is rather a wild country,
you know; and I have told you my opinion
of Garrish and his crowd before.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that Billings took a
train to Chicago to head you off?” questioned
Jack. “He might have gained some new information
that he wanted to get to you as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he took no train,” interposed
Hank Butts. “Leastwise, not from this station.
I’ve asked the station master, and he named over
everybody who got a ticket and went aboard, both
ways. If he took a train at all, it would have
been from some other place.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you figure it out at all, Butts?” questioned
the twins’ father.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. I don’t think Garrish is the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
to shoot another fellow. He’s too much of a
coward. But he might play Lew some underhand
trick. I think Lew made a big mistake to mention
you and that Mr. Renton.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that gave this Peter Garrish an idea
that Billings knew too much and ought to be
gotten out of the way,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“It almost looks like that,” answered his uncle.
“But the question just now is: What did they
do with the man?”</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for some time
longer, but no one could suggest a solution of
the mystery. Lew Billings, the individual Tom
Rover had depended on in his fight to maintain
his rights in the Rolling Thunder mine, had disappeared,
and Tom was almost at a standstill
concerning what to do next.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going over to Sunset Trail?” demanded
Randy anxiously. “You aren’t going to
back out, are you, Dad?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going to back out,” was the firm
reply. “But I suppose I’ll have to change my
plans somewhat, awaiting the reappearance of
Lew Billings or some word from him. He wrote
that he had important information, but he didn’t
give sufficient details for me to go ahead alone.
If Billings doesn’t show up, I suppose all I can
do is to wait until Mr. Renton comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Hank Butts had come over to Maporah on
horseback, leading one other steed, that belonging
to Lew Billings.</p>

<p>“And that proves that Lew didn’t go away
on horseback,” said Butts, “because it’s the only
nag he owns. I brought him over in case I met
up with you,” and he nodded to Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to find some sort of mounts for
the boys,” answered the twins’ father. “Otherwise,
we’ll have to make some arrangement to
stay here.”</p>

<p>“You might get a shakedown over to Gus
Terwilliger’s,” answered the old miner, waving his
hand toward the store. “He’s got a kind of
bunkhouse in the back there. It ain’t much of
a place, but the miners and cowboys use it sometimes,
when they’ve got to wait for trains.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he has any horses?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say. He might have.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose they have anything in the
way of an auto running up that way?” came from
Fred.</p>

<p>“Not much!” and for the first time since meeting
them Hank Butts grinned. “Pretty good
going down here, but once you get in the mountains,
and you couldn’t run an auto a hundred
yards. Besides, some of them trails is so narrow
a horse can’t scarcely navigate ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“In that case, how did they get the mining
machinery up there?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“It all had to come in by the lower route, lad.
It’s over a hundred miles more than this way
around. But they had to do it, for there ain’t
no other way to reach Gold Hill—that is, by
wagon.”</p>

<p>The crowd had walked away from the station
and now came back to find the place deserted
and locked up.</p>

<p>“No more trains to stop here until nine o’clock
to-morrow morning,” announced Hank Butts, as
he untied the two horses and offered one of the
steeds to Tom Rover. “Each of us might carry
one of the boys, but I don’t see how we could
carry two,” he went on.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to the store and see what we
can do,” answered the twins’ father, and with
the boys walking and the men riding they soon
reached the general store which the miner had indicated.
Here the last of the customers had
departed, and the proprietor sat in an easy chair
dozing with his pipe hanging from the corner
of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Sure! I can give you a shakedown for the
night if you want it,” said Gus Terwilliger, after
the situation had been explained to him. “Or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
if you want it, I may be able to fit you out with
horses.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know you had so many animals, Gus!”
exclaimed Butts, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, a general store like this has got to keep
everything,” answered the storekeeper, with a
grin, and then went on to explain that six cowboys
had gone away on a vacation and had left
their steeds in his care.</p>

<p>“They said I could hire ’em out to any responsible
parties that came along,” went on Gus
Terwilliger. “They’d be mighty glad to get a
little money out of the beasts instead of having
’em eat their heads off in my corral. Cowboys
ain’t any too wealthy, you know.”</p>

<p>The quarters the storekeeper had to offer were
clean and fairly comfortable, and after another
talk with Hank Butts Tom Rover decided to stay
at Maporah over night.</p>

<p>“If we went over to Gold Hill with you it
might only make more trouble for you,” he explained
to the old miner. “You had better go
back and say nothing about having seen me. We
can ride over to-morrow just as well as not.
But I’m going to depend on you as a friend,
Butts,” he added, taking the old miner by the
hand. “And if you hear of anything worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
knowing, don’t fail to let me know about it and
at once.”</p>

<p>To this the old miner agreed, and a few minutes
later set off on horseback, taking Lew
Billings’s mount with him. Then the Rovers
reëntered the general store and asked the proprietor
if he could give them their supper.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! And breakfast, too,” answered
Gus Terwilliger. “That’s what my wife and two
daughters are here for—to wait on all customers.”</p>

<p>The boys were shown a place where they could
wash, and a little later they and their uncle were
conducted to a small but comfortable dining room
and there treated to a home-cooked meal that,
while perhaps not as elaborate as those served
on the train, was entirely satisfactory. The two
Terwilliger girls waited on the table and smiled
broadly at the visitors.</p>

<p>“Going to work in the mine?” questioned one
of the girls, a miss of fifteen.</p>

<p>“No. We came out to hunt elephants,” answered
Andy, with a wink, and thereupon both
girls giggled and soon became quite friendly.</p>

<p>After the meal the horses were brought out
and examined and Tom Rover, with the aid of
the boys, selected five of the mounts, and also
hired the sixth animal for the purpose of transporting
their baggage up to Sunset Trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Tom, things don’t look very
bright, do they?” questioned Jack of his uncle
when they were ready to turn in.</p>

<p>“They certainly do not, Jack,” was the sober
reply. “This unexpected disappearance of Lew
Billings upsets me a good deal. I hardly know
what to expect when I reach the mine.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll have trouble with this
Peter Garrish?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“I certainly do! A whole lot of trouble!” answered
Tom Rover.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>AT THE ROLLING THUNDER MINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What a magnificent view!”</p>

<p>It was Jack Rover who spoke. The party had
been on the way to Sunset Trail for over two
hours. All were mounted on the steeds Tom
Rover had hired from the storekeeper and behind
them came the extra horse loaded down with their
belongings.</p>

<p>“I’ll say it’s a fine view!” declared Fred, who
was riding beside his cousin.</p>

<p>They had reached the top of one of the foothills
of the Rocky Mountains and on all sides
stretched rocks and forests with here and there
a great mound rearing its head toward the sky.
At one point there was a sharp cleft in the mountainside,
and from this rushed a torrent of water,
making a thundering sound as it reached the rocks
and the river bed far below.</p>

<p>“That’s where the Rolling Thunder mine gets
its name,” said Tom Rover, pointing to the
waterfall. “If you close your eyes you’ll think
the sound very much like rolling thunder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>“Is the mine over there?” questioned Andy
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes. But you can’t see it from this point.
We’ve got to cover at least two miles more before
we get in sight of the place.”</p>

<p>“And where is Sunset Trail?” questioned Jack,
with equal eagerness.</p>

<p>“That’s just above and a little to the south of
the falls,” answered his uncle. “We’ll hit that
trail just before we get to Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>The climbing up and down the foothills leading
to the mountains beyond was no easy task for
either horses or riders, yet the boys enjoyed the
outing thoroughly.</p>

<p>“It beats reciting in a classroom all hollow,”
was the way Randy expressed himself. “Me for
a life in the open air every time!”</p>

<p>“I knew you boys would enjoy this,” declared
Tom Rover. “If it wasn’t for what I’ve got on
my mind just now I’d be as crazy about it as
you are,” and for an instant there was an old-time
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Tom, don’t worry about the mine
all the time!” burst out Fred. “Things may
straighten themselves out quicker than you expect.”</p>

<p>“I hope they do,” answered his uncle. But
almost immediately his face again resumed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
worried look. The disappearance of Lew Billings
had affected him deeply.</p>

<p>Tom Rover had already explained to the boys
that many of the men at the mine kept house
for themselves and that there was also something
of a boarding house, presided over by a colored
man, Toby White, who at one time had been a
chef in a San Francisco hotel. It was at Toby
White’s boarding house they hoped to obtain accommodations
during their stay at Gold Hill.</p>

<p>“But of course we won’t want to stay at the
boarding house all the time,” said Fred, as the
party rode along. “We want to get out on Sunset
Trail and do some hunting and fishing.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to go out as much as you
please, Fred,” answered his uncle. “All I ask
of you is that you keep out of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know how to take care of ourselves,”
answered the youngest Rover confidently.</p>

<p>“But remember, Uncle Tom, we won’t want
to leave you if you need us,” put in Jack quickly.
“If there is any fighting to be done, we want to
be right alongside to help you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect any fighting, Jack,” was the
reply. “Peter Garrish isn’t that kind of a man.
As Hank Butts said, he’s a good deal of a coward.
If he tries anything at all, it will be in a very
underhand way. What I want him to do is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
open the books of the concern and let me talk
with the superintendent and the others in charge
of the mine and find out exactly how things are
going. I have an idea they are selling a good
portion of their ore to another concern at a low
price and that that concern is owned by Garrish
and his friends.”</p>

<p>It was not yet noon when they came in sight
of Gold Hill. As they made a turn of the mountain
trail they came again within sound of the
thundering falls, which was now below them.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Rolling Thunder mine was
not a prepossessing one. The opening was in
the side of the hill and from it ran a small railway
to a crusher a short distance off. There
were half a dozen buildings, some of wood and
some covered with galvanized iron. Half a dozen
men were moving about and they gazed curiously
at the new arrivals.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to Toby White’s boarding house
first and see what sort of accommodations we can
get there,” said Tom Rover. “I don’t want to
give Garrish a chance to keep us out.”</p>

<p>“Keep us out! What do you mean?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“He might give Toby a tip not to take us in.
He might try to make it so uncomfortable that
we couldn’t stay here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“But we could camp out if we had to!” cried
Fred.</p>

<p>“Sure we could! And that’s what I’ll do if
we have to,” answered his uncle.</p>

<p>Tom had been at Toby White’s before, at the
time he had made his investment in the mine,
and as he had treated the colored boarding-house
keeper rather liberally, White was all smiles when
he recognized his visitor.</p>

<p>“I suah am proud to see you, Mistah Rover,”
he said, bowing. “Got your fambly with you,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I have, Toby. My two sons and my two
nephews. I want to know if you’ve got accommodations
for us.”</p>

<p>“I ce’tainly has. Come right in and make
you’selves at home. Dinner will be ready in half
an hour.”</p>

<p>“We may want to stay quite a while, Toby,”
went on Tom Rover, as he dismounted, his action
being followed by the boys.</p>

<p>“Stay as long as you please, sir. I can give
you a room to you’self and I’ve got two other
rooms where the young gentlemen can double
up. Just come right in, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’d have been so friendly if he
knew Uncle Tom was after Peter Garrish’s scalp,”
whispered Fred to his cousins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Hush, Fred,” admonished Jack in a low tone.
“You’d better keep all that sort of talk under
your hat for the present.”</p>

<p>Having proceeded to make themselves at home
in the rooms by putting away their belongings,
the boys rejoined Tom Rover, who had announced
that he was going over to the office of the mine,
one of the small buildings near the mouth of the
mine shaft.</p>

<p>“It’s just possible Garrish may want to see me
alone,” announced Tom Rover. “So if I give
you boys the hint just make yourselves scarce
for the time being,” and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>“But don’t forget if you need us just yell and
we’ll come running,” announced Randy. He had
heard his mother warn his father not to get into
a fight with the mine manager.</p>

<p>While Tom Rover walked over to the office the
boys wandered down to the mine opening, gazing
curiously at the darkness beyond where only a
few lights flickered.</p>

<p>“Gee, I never could see what there was in being
a miner—I mean a fellow to work way in the
bowels of the earth like this,” remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t think this is as bad as a coal mine,”
answered Andy. “Gosh! that would get your
goat, sure. Those poor fellows are hundreds
and hundreds of feet out of sight of daylight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
If anything gives way, it’s all up with them.
I’d rather be a lineman working on the top of
telephone poles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, or even an aviator flying through the
clouds,” added his twin.</p>

<p>When Tom Rover entered the office attached
to the mine he found two young clerks in charge.
Neither of them was working. One had a newspaper
in his hand and from this was reading some
baseball scores. They stared in wonder at their
visitor.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Peter Garrish around?” questioned
Tom. His manner was one of authority and the
clerks felt instinctively that here was some one
who was entitled to their attention.</p>

<p>“Mr. Garrish just stepped out to the mine for
a few minutes,” answered one of the clerks.
“He’ll be back presently. Anything I can do
for you?”</p>

<p>“Did he go down in the mine?” questioned
Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“No, he only went over to call up one of the
gang foremen. They’re getting ready to set off
another charge down there.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll walk over and see if I can find him.”</p>

<p>The boys walked around the mouth of the mine
and then stepped inside for several yards in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
that they might get a better view of what was
beyond. They were straining their eyes in the
semi-darkness when suddenly Jack felt a rather
rough hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows! What are you doing here?”
cried an unsympathetic voice. “Don’t you know
that strangers have no business in this mine?”</p>

<p>“Excuse us, but we didn’t know we were intruding,”
answered Jack, and he and the others
retreated to the mouth of the opening, followed
by the man who had accosted them. He was a
tall, thin individual with gray hair and steely blue-gray
eyes.</p>

<p>“Where did you boys come from?” questioned
the man abruptly, and looked sharply from one
to another.</p>

<p>“My brother and I came with my father,” answered
Randy. “These two fellows are my
cousins.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Randy Rover,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Randy Rover!” repeated the man, and his
manner showed his astonishment. “Are you all
Rovers?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you the sons of Mr. Thomas Rover of
New York?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“We are,” answered Andy.</p>

<p>“Humph! Did your father send you out
here?”</p>

<p>“No. We came with him,” answered Randy,
and then he continued quickly: “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know that? I thought everybody
knew me. I am Mr. Peter Garrish, and I am
in charge here. You say you came with your
father—where is he?”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now,” answered Randy, as
Tom Rover strode toward the crowd.</p>

<p>Peter Garrish looked, and as he saw the parent
of the twins his face took on a look of commingled
fear and anger. He compressed his lips
and gave a slight toss to his head.</p>

<p>“Came to make trouble, I suppose,” he snarled,
“Well, it won’t do him any good!”</p>

<small>OUT ON SUNSET TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>If Peter Garrish was ill at ease, it must be
confessed that Tom Rover was also somewhat
perplexed regarding the best way of approaching
the manager of the mine. He had thought to get
a great deal of data concerning the mine from
Lew Billings and then confront Garrish with these
proofs of his wrongdoing.</p>

<p>“Came to look the place over, I suppose?” said
Garrish, eyeing Tom distrustfully.</p>

<p>“I did,” answered the father of the twins
bluntly. “And I also came to take a look at the
books.”</p>

<p>“Take a look at the books, Mr. Rover? What’s
in the wind now?” and Garrish’s voice took on a
decidedly unpleasant tone.</p>

<p>“I won’t beat around the bush, Garrish. You
know that for a long time I have not been satisfied
with the way things are going here. I have
got a lot of money tied up in this mine, and I
don’t intend to lose it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Who said you were going to lose it?” demanded
the manager.</p>

<p>“Nobody said so, Garrish. But I can put two
and two together as well as the next fellow. I
don’t like the way things are running here. By
the way, what have you done to Lew Billings?”</p>

<p>“Billings! I haven’t done anything to Billings.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be missing.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s his fault and not mine. We had
something of an argument and I told him if he
was not willing to carry out my orders he had
better look for a job. Since that I haven’t seen
or heard of him.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have disappeared very mysteriously,
Garrish,” went on Tom suggestively.</p>

<p>“See here, Rover, do you want to start something?”
snarled the manager. “If you do, I’ll
tell you right now it won’t get you anywhere!
I’ve had nothing to do with Billings’ disappearance.
He went off on his own hook. Now, I
know you’re a stockholder here and you’ve got
a stockholder’s rights. But you must remember
that I’m the manager and that I represent the
majority of the stockholders. I’m willing to do
what’s fair, but I won’t be bulldozed.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t ask you to do anything but what is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
fair, Garrish,” answered Tom. “You certainly
ought not to object to a large stockholder like
myself looking over the books and taking a look
around the mine.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. But you’ve got to treat me
as a manager ought to be treated, or you’ll keep
out of the office and out of the mine too.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps after——” began Tom, and
then suddenly stopped and said instead: “Well,
have it your own way, Garrish. Just the same,
I don’t think you’re treating me quite decently,
seeing that I have seventy-five thousand dollars
locked up in this mining company.”</p>

<p>“Other people have over half a million dollars
locked up in it. I’m representing them as well
as you. You know the majority rule, and I
am taking my orders from the majority.”</p>

<p>After this there was a sharp exchange of words
lasting ten minutes or more. During that time
Peter Garrish tried to draw Tom out, but the
father of the twins refused to commit himself
any further than stating that he had come West
to look over the mine and likewise the books.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t go down in the mine to-day,
and probably not to-morrow,” said Peter Garrish
at last. “We are using a lot of dynamite
and it might be dangerous. As soon as it’s safe
you can go down and take a look around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“All right, that’s fair,” answered Tom. “Now,
what about the books?”</p>

<p>“The two bookkeepers are busy to-day making
out the pay roll and doing some other things,
but I’ll fix it so you can go over the books with
them in a couple of days.”</p>

<p>This was as much as Peter Garrish was willing
to concede. Then he added that they might obtain
accommodations from the general storekeeper
at Maporah.</p>

<p>“Yes, we stopped there last night,” answered
Tom. “But now we have already made arrangements
to stay at Toby White’s boarding house.”</p>

<p>“Toby White’s!” exclaimed the manager, and
it was evident that this information did not please
him in the least. “Toby had no business to take
you in. That boarding house is run exclusively
for mine employees.”</p>

<p>“Well, he had room, and he took us in. I
don’t see what harm there is in it when the rooms
are vacant.”</p>

<p>“That place is on mining property, and Toby
understood the boarding house was to be exclusively
for our employees. Of course, if you,
as a stockholder, want to stay there, I’ll raise no
objections. But I don’t see what we’re going to
do with these boys around.”</p>

<p>“We don’t expect to stay around very much,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
put in Randy quickly. “We’re going out on
Sunset Trail to see if we can stir up any fishing
and hunting.”</p>

<p>Another argument started over the question of
the boarding house, but here Tom Rover was
firm and stated that they would stay as long as
the colored man would permit them. Then some
one came to tell the manager that they were getting
ready to set off the charge as ordered, and
he said he would have to leave and see that everything
was all right. But before going down into
the mine he hurried off to the office, where he
closed the door sharply behind him.</p>

<p>“Uncle Tom, those bookkeepers were not busy
at all!” whispered Jack. “When we looked in
at the window they were both looking over a
newspaper and talking about baseball scores.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” answered his uncle, with a
peculiar look in his eyes. “I think I know how
to handle this Peter Garrish. He puts on the
front of a bulldog, and just at present I’m going
to let him do it. But before I get through with
him I’ll make him squeal like a stuck pig. Don’t
you boys give him any information, and especially
don’t say a word about those stockholders I
stopped off to see in Chicago. You just go back
to the boarding house, and then you can go out
on Sunset Trail if you want to. I’m going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
ride back to Maporah. I want to send off several
telegrams. He says he has the backing of
the majority of the stockholders. Well, he won’t
have when I get through with him.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s the way to talk, Dad!” exclaimed
Randy, in admiration. “You get the other stockholders
to back you up, and you can soon give
Mr. Peter Garrish his walking papers.”</p>

<p>All returned to the boarding house. A little
later Tom Rover set off on his return to the
railroad station. Then the boys, with nothing
else to do, looked over their hunting and fishing
outfits and, after dinner, went off on horseback
to do a little exploring.</p>

<p>They found Sunset Trail a fairly good highway
leading westward. It wound in and out
among the hills and mountains, and there were
numerous high spots where the descending sun
might be viewed to advantage.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is where the name comes from,”
remarked Fred, as they came to a halt at one
of these high spots to view their surroundings.
“It must be beautiful here when the sun is setting
beyond those distant mountains.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s very much in the way
of hunting around here,” remarked Jack. “So
far I haven’t seen a sign of anything outside of
a few squirrels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to get some trout or pickerel,” came
from Fred. “Gee, I haven’t been fishing for
almost a year!”</p>

<p>“Speaking of fishing puts me in mind of Clearwater
Lake,” remarked Randy. “I wonder if
Phil Franklin has done anything about looking
for that silver trophy we lost overboard.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I certainly wish that was found!” sighed
his twin. “They ought to be able to get at it
somehow, if they fish long enough.”</p>

<p>The boys rode up a long hill and then went
down the somewhat steep decline on the other
side. At the foot they found a fair-sized stream
of water rushing along through the rocks.</p>

<p>“Here is a pretty good trail,” announced Jack.
“And look, isn’t that a lake?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is!” cried Fred. “Come on!
Let’s ride over and see what it looks like. Maybe
we’ll have a chance for some fishing to-day,”
he added, for they had brought their rods along
and also a box of assorted flies.</p>

<p>The trail was rocky in spots, but the horses
seemed to be used to this sort of going and
made fairly good progress. Presently they came
out on the edge of the lake which seemed to be
about half a mile long and over two hundred
yards wide. There were numerous rocks on the
shore interspersed with brushwood and trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“There ought to be something in the way of
fish in this lake,” remarked Jack. “Let’s try our
luck and rest the horses at the same time.”</p>

<p>The lake was located about seven miles directly
westward from Gold Hill and in a spot evidently
but little visited by the natives. Not a building
of any sort was in sight, and when the boys
discovered the remains of a campfire they came
to the conclusion that the fire must have been
built months before.</p>

<p>Tethering the horses so as to make sure the
animals would not stray away, the four boys
quickly unslung their fishing outfits and got them
ready for use.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we ought to fish with—flies
or worms,” said Randy. “What do you
think?” and he looked at Jack.</p>

<p>“If we can find any worms we might mix it
up,” was the reply, and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>Having baited to their satisfaction, the boys
wandered along the bank of the lake, seeking
various points that might look advantageous.
Jack and Andy found convenient fallen trees
while the others walked out on a rocky point that
projected far into the water.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, I’ve got something!” cried Randy,
after a few minutes of silence, and brought up a
lake trout about nine inches long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“Good for us!” came from Jack. “Not so very
large, but it’s the first catch, anyway.”</p>

<p>For some time after that the fish did not seem
to bite. But presently Jack brought in a trout
weighing at least a pound, and then the others
were equally successful. Inside of an hour they
had a mess between them weighing five or six
pounds.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re going to have fish for supper all
right enough,” declared Fred, with satisfaction.
“I don’t see why the miners and other folks
around here don’t do more fishing.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t pay as well as mining, that’s why,”
answered Jack. “Just look at it, we’ve been here
nearly two hours, and we’ve got about two dollars’
worth of fish. If the four of us were working
at the mine we’d have earned at least eight
dollars in that time.”</p>

<p>“This wouldn’t be a bad spot for camping,”
suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“Suppose we ride around the lake,” suggested
his twin. “There seems to be a trail all the
way around.”</p>

<p>The others were willing, and soon the fishing
tackle was put away and they were once more
on horseback.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the lake they found another
stream of water running between a mass of dense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
brushwood. Here the trail was narrow and the
horses had to pick their way, for the spring
freshets had thrown the loose stones in all directions.</p>

<p>“Maybe we had better turn back,” came from
Fred. “The trail seems to be getting worse instead
of better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon it will be all right on the higher
ground,” answered Jack. “When the snows
melted last spring I suppose the water was pretty
fierce down here where the lake empties.”</p>

<p>Andy and Randy had pushed ahead, and now
they disappeared around a bend of the trail. A
moment later came a yell.</p>

<p>“Hi! Look out, boys! There’s some wild
animal here! He’s up a tree!” came from Andy.</p>

<p>Then came a snarl, followed by a snort of
fright from the horse Randy was riding. The
next instant something came flying through the
leaves of the tree, landing on the horse’s flank.</p>

<small>THE MOUNTAIN LION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It’s a wildcat!”</p>

<p>“No, it’s a mountain lion, and it’s going to
attack Randy!”</p>

<p>“Shoot the beast!”</p>

<p>“Look out or you’ll shoot Randy!”</p>

<p>“There they go—through the bushes!”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>Such were the startled exclamations from the
other three boys. The yell from Andy had
brought Fred and Jack hurrying forward, and
they were just in time to see the wild animal
land on the flank of the horse. Then the steed,
evidently terror stricken, dashed into the brushwood
alongside the trail, carrying Randy with
him.</p>

<p>“Was it really a mountain lion?”</p>

<p>“Where did they go?”</p>

<p>“Randy! Randy! Can’t you shoot the beast?”
screamed Andy.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left Andy’s lips when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
there came a scream from his twin and another
wild snort from the horse. Then there was added
to the tumult the snarl of the mountain lion and
an instant later the beast dropped from the horse
and shot through the brushwood directly in front
of where Jack and Fred had brought their mounts
to a halt.</p>

<p>The boys had brought their guns with them,
but not having noticed any game worth shooting
at had placed the weapons behind them. Both
Jack and Fred made frantic efforts to get their
weapons into action, but before they could aim
at the mountain lion it had whirled around and
disappeared up a rocky trail and then behind a
clump of brushwood. An instant later they saw
it streaking up the mountainside. Jack took aim
and so did Fred, but before either could pull a
trigger the beast disappeared.</p>

<p>“Randy! Randy! Are you all right?” called
out his twin anxiously, for they could hear the
horse Randy was riding thrashing viciously
around in the brushwood some distance away.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” Randy called out. “Whoa,
I tell you! You’re all right now, old boy! Keep
quiet! Whoa!” The boy continued to talk to
the horse and do his best to subdue the animal.
But the nails of the mountain lion had been dug
deep into his flank and he evidently felt as if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
had been scourged with a whip. He continued
to prance here and there and then, of a sudden,
streaked off across a clearing that led upward.</p>

<p>“There they go!” shouted Jack. “The horse is
running away!”</p>

<p>“Hold tight, Randy!” shouted Fred. “Don’t
let him throw you!” For a dash upon those
sharp rocks that lay strewn all over the open
space might mean death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Randy had slung his fishing rod
beside his gun and had tied his share of the fish
in a cloth behind his saddle. Consequently, his
hands were free to hold the reins, and this he
did grimly as the horse pranced over the field
very much like an untamed broncho.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” went on Randy, doing his
best to subdue his mount. “Whoa, I tell you!
That wildcat—or whatever it was—is gone.”</p>

<p>As the horse shot across the field and among
some short brushwood, the three boys left behind
headed in that direction. Each had his gun ready
for use, thinking that possibly the mountain lion
or some other wild beast might show itself.</p>

<p>Never had Randy had a rougher experience
than the present. Several times he was all but
flung from the horse as the animal swung around
to avoid hitting one rock or another. Once he
dropped the reins and held on to the horse’s mane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Then the animal stumbled and the lad went up in
the air and it looked for a moment as if he might
go over the horse’s head. But he came back
safely, and at last brought the horse down to a
walk.</p>

<p>“Whoa there, Charley Boy,” he said as soothingly
as a panting breath would permit. “Good
boy now! Keep quiet!” And then he managed
to bring the horse to a standstill.</p>

<p>When the others came up Randy dismounted
and all saw that the horse had received several
deep scratches on the flank, and from these the
blood was still flowing. Randy and Jack attempted
to wipe the blood away, but the horse
would not have this and acted as if he meant to
“kick them into kingdom come,” as Andy expressed
it. So then they let him alone.</p>

<p>“What became of the wildcat?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a wildcat. It was a young mountain
lion,” declared Jack. “Fred and I tried to
get a shot at it, but it got away up the mountainside
before we could get our guns around to taking
aim.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the mountain lion hit you at all,
Randy?” questioned his brother anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, he missed me by a couple of inches,”
was the reply. “I saw him coming and I dodged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
He went right over my shoulder and then struck
the horse. Of course Charley Boy wouldn’t stand
for that, and he swung around as if hit with
a red-hot whip. That threw the mountain lion
to the ground, and what happened to the animal
after that I don’t know because I had my hands
full with the horse.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’m sorry we didn’t get a crack at that
beast!” said Fred regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing sure,” returned Andy,
and something of a grin showed on his face.
“We know that there’s one kind of game around
here. In fact, two kinds, if you’re going to count
the fish.”</p>

<p>After the horse that had been attacked had
been thoroughly subdued the boys continued on
the trail around the lake. Now, however, they
kept their guns handy, hoping they might get
a sight of the mountain lion or some other game.</p>

<p>But nothing appeared and, having come to
the point from which they had started, they
climbed up the road leading to Sunset Trail.
By this time the sun was descending behind the
mountains to the westward and they thought it
time to return to Gold Hill.</p>

<p>When they got back to the boarding house they
found that Peter Garrish had been busy during
their absence. Evidently the mine manager had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
called upon the colored man who kept the place,
for Toby was no longer as affable as he had been
on their first appearance.</p>

<p>“Very sorry to tell you,” he announced. “But
I’m expecting some other miners in a day or
two, so I’ll have to ask you all to give up your
rooms and go elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Have you told my father this, White?” demanded
Randy.</p>

<p>“I ain’t seen your father. He didn’t even
come back for his dinner.”</p>

<p>“That’s because he had to go away on an
errand,” answered Andy. “He said he’d be back
by supper time, and it’s almost that now. You
had better not try to do anything until you see
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to have the rooms, that’s all
there is to it,” answered Toby White, and started
to shuffle off.</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Garrish put you up to this,”
called Jack after him.</p>

<p>“That don’t make no difference—I’ve got to
have them rooms,” muttered the colored man,
and then went away.</p>

<p>A little later Tom Rover appeared and the boys
at once acquainted him with what Toby White
had said. They had agreed to say nothing about
the encounter with the mountain lion, fearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
that Tom might keep them from going out camping
as they had hoped to do.</p>

<p>“I expected something of that sort,” answered
the twins’ father. “And after I had sent off my
telegrams I had a talk with Terwilliger, the
keeper of the store. He told me of a man who
lives up on Sunset Trail just a short distance
from here—a man named Corning. I went and
saw this Corning, who used to run the Mary
Casey mine. I made an arrangement to stop
at Corning’s house provided we were put out
here. Corning has his two old-maid sisters with
him, and Terwilliger says they are good cooks
and good housekeepers, so I imagine we won’t
miss anything by making a change.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you want to keep an eye on this
place?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going to keep an eye on it, and in
a way Garrish little expects. But I won’t be
able to do much openly until I hear from Mr.
Renton and two other stockholders named Parkhurst
and Leeds. If I can get those three stockholders
to act with me we’ll control a majority
of the stock, and then we’ll be able to run things
here to suit ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything at all from Billings?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Not a word. He wasn’t seen around Maporah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
nor at Allways, the next station. I am satisfied
that he is either in hiding or else he’s met with
foul play.”</p>

<p>The meal served to the Rovers that evening
was a fairly good one, but it was plainly to be
seen that Toby White was more than anxious
to have them take their departure. Tom said but
little to the colored man, fearing that the fellow
was entirely under Garrish’s thumb.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in staying where I’m not
wanted,” he told Toby White. “I’ll settle with
you right now and we’ll leave as soon as we
can pack our things.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, Mr. Rover, very sorry,” said the colored
man. “But you know how it is here—this
place is leased to me by the mining company and
I’ve got to keep my rooms for nothing but
miners.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. And we’ll go.” And shortly
after that the boys and Tom Rover took their
departure.</p>

<p>It was not a long journey to Cal Corning’s
place, a long, low log cabin containing eight
rooms, all on the ground floor. Behind the cabin
were half a dozen outbuildings, for Corning was
the only man in that vicinity who kept any cattle.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll say this is an improvement over
Toby White’s place,” remarked Jack, when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
were settling down in the three rooms assigned
to them. Two were of fair size, and these were
taken by the boys, while the third, a smaller
room, went to Tom Rover.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a deal with Corning,” announced
the twins’ father, when the Rovers were alone.
“He is going to keep an eye on the office of the
Rolling Thunder mine.”</p>

<p>“The office?” asked Jack. “Is he an expert
bookkeeper, or something like that?”</p>

<p>“No, no! Nothing of that sort, Jack,” and
Tom Rover smiled. “I’m simply going to have
him watch, so that Garrish doesn’t take it into
his head to have the records of the mining company
carted away. I want to get at the bottom
of this deal with that concern that is getting a
good part of our ore.”</p>

<p>After that several days slipped by without anything
unusual happening. Tom and the boys
took a look around the outside of the mine, and
even glanced in at the office. They saw Peter
Garrish, but had no further words with him.</p>

<p>“He can stew until I’m ready to move,” said
Tom to the boys. “I’ll wager he’s doing a lot
of deep thinking right now.”</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day the boys
rode over to Maporah to post some letters, the
post-office being in Gus Terwilliger’s store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>“Here are some letters for you fellows, and
also a letter for Mr. Rover,” said the storekeeper,
and he handed the epistles over. “They came in
on the noon train.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s just what we’ve been looking
for,” cried Fred.</p>

<p>Then the boys went outside and sat down on
the stoop of the store to read the communications.</p>

<p>“Here comes a fellow tearing along on horseback,”
announced Jack, looking up. “He seems
in a tremendous hurry.”</p>

<p>The rider had come from a trail which crossed
the railroad close to the station. Now he sailed
past the Terwilliger store at full speed. He wore
a miner’s outfit, and the flap of his broad-brimmed
hat flew back in the breeze. In less than a quarter
of a minute he was out of sight down a side
trail.</p>

<p>“My stars!” ejaculated Fred, leaping to his
feet. “Did you recognize that man?”</p>

<p>“It was Tate—the oil man from Texas!” answered
Randy.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>AT LAKE GANSEN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Are you sure it was Tate?” demanded Andy,
who had had his back turned to the rider.</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” answered his twin.</p>

<p>“What in the world can that man be doing
here?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me!” returned Randy. “I suppose
now they’ve let him out of prison he has as much
right to roam around as Davenport has.”</p>

<p>“I remember now that Tate did come from
the West,” said Jack. “He was a miner before
he became an oil man. Perhaps he’s interesting
himself in the mines in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have anything to do with the
Rolling Thunder mine, could he?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and ask Mr. Terwilliger if he
knows Tate,” suggested Fred, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Never heard of such an individual,” answered
the storekeeper when the question had been put
to him. “I don’t believe he belongs around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
here. Anyway, he doesn’t get any mail at this
office.”</p>

<p>The boys talked the matter over for several
minutes more. But then they were anxious to
get at their letters and returned to the store stoop
for that purpose. There were long letters from
the girls postmarked at Jacksonville, Florida,
where the steam yacht on which they were taking
their outing had stopped. One letter to Jack
was from Ruth, and this, it can well be imagined,
the young major read with much interest. Ruth
was enjoying herself greatly and trusted that
Jack and his cousins were having a good time.</p>

<p>“Hello, here’s news that’s mighty interesting!”
cried Randy. “Here is a letter from Phil Franklin,
and he says that he and Barry Logan have
made half a dozen efforts to bring up the silver
trophy from the bottom of the lake. He says
that once they had it hooked up and brought it
to the top of the water, but before they could
grab it the thing slipped from the trawl and sank
out of sight again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shame!” murmured his twin.
“To almost have it and then lose it again!”</p>

<p>“It’s just like the big fish that gets away,”
returned Fred. “But, anyway,” he added, his
face brightening, “they must know the exact spot
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“They do,” answered his cousin. “Phil writes
that as soon as the vase slipped out of sight he
and Barry took a piece of fish line, weighted
it well, and let it go down to the bottom. Then
they tied a bit of board to the top of the line,
and on this hoisted a rag on a stick so they could
see the board from a distance. He wrote this
letter the day after the thing happened and said
they were going out again just as soon as it
stopped raining.”</p>

<p>“They’ll get it, I’m sure of it!” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll feel better when that silver trophy
is safe in the glass case in the gymnasium,” answered
Randy.</p>

<p>All was going well with the folks who were
taking the steam yacht trip, and for this the
boys were thankful. They had a letter from
Sam Rover, and from this learned that he and
Jack’s father were exceedingly busy in Wall
Street. There was also a letter from Dick Rover,
but this was for Tom. When the latter received
this communication he read it with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Your dad is right on the job,” he said to
Jack. “He had been communicating with two
other stockholders in the Rolling Thunder mine
and has got them to put their proxies in my
hands. That means that I can vote for them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
at any meeting of the stockholders that may be
called. Those two men represent a hundred and
ten thousand dollars’ worth of stock. And that
means that I can get along without Leeds if I
have to. All I shall want now is the backing
of Mr. Renton and Mr. Parkhurst and then I’ll
be ready to put the screws on Garrish.”</p>

<p>The boys told Tom Rover of having seen Tate,
and this interested the twins’ father at once.</p>

<p>“You want to keep your eyes open for that
rascal,” said Tom. “He used to be in cahoots
with Davenport, and he may be yet.”</p>

<p>“We’ll watch out for him, never fear,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>All of the boys were anxious to go farther
westward on Sunset Trail and it was finally
arranged for them to take an outing to last several
days. They went on horseback, carrying
such things as they needed with them.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty wild country, don’t forget that,”
said Tom Rover. “But you have been out before
and have always been able to take care of
yourselves, so I don’t suppose that I should
worry. Just the same, remember that I shall be
thinking of you,” and he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“And we’ll be thinking about you, Dad,” said
Andy. “I hope by the time we get back you’ll
be in a position to tell Garrish where he gets off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“I hope so myself, Son.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you have a hot time with him when
you tell him to clear out,” put in Randy.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully queer you don’t get some sort
of word from that Lew Billings,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t get word very well if he’s dead,”
was Fred’s comment.</p>

<p>“Hank Butts gave me an idea yesterday,” said
Tom Rover. “He’s got a hunch that Billings
was made a prisoner by the Garrish crowd first
and that he got away and is now in hiding, probably
watching what is being done by that outside
company that is taking some of our ore. Of
course, Butts may be mistaken, but he’s a rather
shrewd old fellow and may have struck the truth.”</p>

<p>As the weather was clear and warm the boys
did not deem it necessary to take much in the
way of shelter. They carried their sleeping bags
and also a dog tent and blankets, and that was
all. They took with them a few cooking utensils
and a few necessary provisions.</p>

<p>“We know we can get fish and we ought to
be able to get some small game,” said Jack. “Anyway,
it won’t hurt us to rough it. If we have
to starve a bit, why, that may be good for our
digestions,” and he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“We shan’t starve as long as we have got our
beans and bacon,” answered Fred. “We’ll get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
along. We’ve done it before, and we can do it
again.”</p>

<p>From Cal Corning they obtained directions
regarding the best points to visit along Sunset
Trail.</p>

<p>“That lake you fished in was Dogberry Lake,”
said their host. “About ten miles farther on
is Gansen Lake. I know you’ll like it up there.
The fishing is good, and you ought to be able
to stir up something in the way of game.”</p>

<p>Once on the road, the boys felt in high spirits
and for the time being the trouble at the Rolling
Thunder mine was forgotten. Swinging his cap
high in the air, Andy led the way with Fred close
behind him and Jack and Randy following.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what—this is the life!” sang out
Andy gayly. “I feel as if I could keep riding
right along to the Pacific Ocean.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good,” answered Fred. “But I think
your horse will have something to say about that.
You’d better take it a bit slow climbing these
hills.”</p>

<p>The two Corning sisters had put up a lunch for
the boys, and this was partaken of shortly after
noon, when they reached a high spot on the trail.
Here was a precipice, and standing on its brink
they could look down into a stony valley six or
seven hundred feet deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, this is a jumping-off place, I’ll say!” remarked
Andy.</p>

<p>“It would be a bad spot for a runaway,” returned
Jack.</p>

<p>Back of the precipice was some brushwood, as
well as a number of tall trees, and here the boys
proceeded to make themselves at home. They
had sandwiches, cake, and some fruit, and that
being so did not deem it necessary to start a fire
for the purpose of making anything hot to drink.
They had passed a spring in coming up to the
precipice, and obtained a bucket of cool, clear
water.</p>

<p>“This region is certainly a lonely one,” said
Jack while they were eating. “Just think—we’ve
been traveling for better than three hours and
haven’t met a soul!”</p>

<p>“It would be a great place for a stage hold-up,”
returned Randy. “The bandits could get away
with almost anything out here.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want any hold-up,” put in Fred.
“All we want to do is to enjoy ourselves,” and
he leaned back contentedly against a tree while
munching a chicken sandwich.</p>

<p>A little later found the boys again on the way,
and by three o’clock in the afternoon they came
in sight of Gansen Lake. The lake was supplied
from a mountain torrent and the torrent contained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
a waterfall ten or twelve feet in height and
half that in width.</p>

<p>“Here is certainly an ideal place for camping
out!” exclaimed Jack. “To my mind, it could
not be better.”</p>

<p>“It’s all to the mustard!” sang out Andy.
“Let’s unload right here and call it a day.”</p>

<p>“That lake looks mighty inviting to me,” declared
Fred. “I’ll say a swim wouldn’t go bad.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve said something!” burst out
Randy. “Let’s get settled as soon as we can and
then go swimming.”</p>

<p>The idea of getting into the lake after the long
and somewhat warm ride appealed to all the lads,
and in less than quarter of an hour they had their
horses unloaded and properly tethered and then
hurried down to a point along the lake shore
where the water looked particularly inviting.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there can be anything dangerous
in this lake,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Nothing more dangerous than a few sharks
and whales,” answered Andy, with a grin.
“What did you expect to find here—leviathans?”</p>

<p>“There might be some water snakes,” put in
Fred. “However, I’m not going to worry about
that. I’m going to have a swim,” and without
further words he proceeded to disrobe and the
others did likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>At first the mountain water seemed exceedingly
cold. But soon the boys got used to it, and then
they proceeded to have as much fun as possible.
They dived and raced, and Andy and his brother
indulged in all manner of horseplay. Near the
shore they found the lake quite shallow, but
farther out they were unable to touch bottom.</p>

<p>“These lakes are very deceiving,” said Jack.
“Sometimes they lie right in between steep mountains
and the bottom is hundreds of feet down.”</p>

<p>“We ought to be careful about diving too
deep,” cautioned Randy. “There might be some
outlet to this lake at the bottom. And if so, a
fellow might be sucked down and be unable to
come up again.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get up another race,” suggested Andy,
after they had gotten through splashing water in
each other’s faces.</p>

<p>“See that rock over yonder?” returned Fred.
“Let’s race to that and back. Come on! Everybody
ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready!”</p>

<p>“Then go!”</p>

<p>Away the boys started side by side, laughing
and shouting merrily. Soon Randy pulled slightly
to the front, with Jack close behind him.</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows, wait for me!” spluttered
Fred, who was last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“The fellow who wins can cook supper for
us!” sang out Jack.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” yelled back Randy. “The
loser can cook supper and wash the dishes too.”</p>

<p>He came in ahead, the others following closely
in a bunch. Then, somewhat out of breath, the
four boys crawled out on some flat rocks to rest
before swimming back to where they had left
their clothing.</p>

<p>“My gracious!” suddenly exclaimed Andy, and
leaped to his feet in astonishment. “Look there,
will you?”</p>

<p>He pointed across the water to a spot midway
between where they had left their clothing and
their camping outfit.</p>

<p>“Wolves!” breathed Jack. “Three of them!
What do you know about that!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>THE TIMBER WOLVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now we are in a pickle!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so! Why, we haven’t even got our
clothing, much less our guns!”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me! I was never good at answering
riddles!”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the four Rover boys gazed in
wonder and astonishment at the sight before
them. Sneaking along cautiously were three
large gray timber wolves, gaunt and fierce in appearance.
They had evidently been attracted to
the spot by the scent of the boys and the horses
and also, possibly, by the bacon in the supplies.</p>

<p>“There comes another one,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and two more are crouched up on the
rocks a short distance behind,” came from Jack.</p>

<p>“Six wolves! Maybe there’s a regular pack of
them.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder. They often travel in
packs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“And they look hungry enough to eat us up,”
came from Fred, and the tone of his voice showed
that he felt anything but comfortable.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, all of the boys felt
uneasy. Not only were they without their clothing
but their four guns lay within a hundred feet
of where the three leading wolves were standing.</p>

<p>The horses had also discovered the wolves and
were now snorting wildly and trying to break
from their tethers. Charley Boy, Randy’s mount,
was particularly nervous, probably from his experience
with the mountain lion.</p>

<p>The wolves had been sniffing first in the direction
of the boys’ clothing and then in the direction
of the supplies and the horses. Now they
looked across the small arm of the lake at the
boys themselves and uttered a series of snarls,
baring their teeth as they did so.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had a rifle or a heavy shotgun!”
murmured the young major.</p>

<p>“Can’t we heave some rocks at them?” suggested
Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would do any good,” answered
Randy. “We’re too far off. We were
foolish to rove around in a wild place like this
without our guns.”</p>

<p>Although the wolves snarled viciously, they did
not as yet make any attempt to approach the four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
boys. Instead, while two sniffed at the clothing
on the rocks, turning it over with their noses and
paws, the others loped over to the supplies.</p>

<p>This was more than the horses could stand,
and, plunging wildly, one after another broke
his tether and shot off out of sight along the
mountainside.</p>

<p>“Good-by to the horses!” cried Fred. “Now
we sure are in a pickle even if we can manage
to get rid of those wolves.”</p>

<p>“They’re coming this way!” yelled Randy.</p>

<p>“Pick up as many loose stones as you can
carry,” ordered Jack. “Then wade out into the
lake. I guess it’s about the only thing we
can do.”</p>

<p>Three of the wolves were advancing around
the arm of the lake in the direction of the boys.
Evidently they were exceedingly hungry, for
otherwise they would have run away at the sight
of human beings.</p>

<p>Small stones were handy, and it did not take
the four boys long to pick up half a dozen each.
Then they waded out in the lake until they were
in water up to their waists. By this time the
three wolves had reached the flat rock on which
the youths had been resting. They snarled repeatedly,
showing their fangs, and their eyes
gleamed in a manner that indicated they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
like nothing better than to get hold of the lads
and make a meal of them.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp234">“Let ’em have a dose of rocks!” cried Jack.</a>
“Be careful how you throw! Don’t waste your
ammunition!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp234">
  <img src="images/i_fp234.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_234">“LET THEM HAVE A DOSE OF ROCKS,” CRIED JACK.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He let fly, and so did the others, and all the
wolves were hit in the head or in the side. They
set up a fearful howl of commingled pain and
rage and then made a move as if to leap into
the lake after the lads.</p>

<p>While this was going on the other wolves had
approached the duffel bags of the boys and were
tearing the outfit apart in an endeavor to get at
the bacon and dried beef the lads carried.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>It was the report of a rifle and the shot startled
the boys quite as much as it did the wolves. Then
came a second crack, and, looking across the arm
of the lake, the boys saw one of the big gray
wolves leap into the air and fall back lifeless.
Then came a third shot and a second wolf sprang
into the air and then came down and with a wild
snarl went limping away into the forest.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, somebody has come to our assistance!”
cried Jack. “Give it to ’em! Give it to
’em good and plenty!” he yelled at the top of
his lungs.</p>

<p>“Plug every one of ’em!” came from Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Shoot ’em down!” added his twin.</p>

<p>“Don’t let any of them get away!” was the
way Fred expressed himself.</p>

<p>At the first crack of the rifle the three wolves
that had come after the boys raised their heads
to listen. Then, as they saw one wolf killed and
another wounded, they waited no longer, but,
turning, leaped swiftly over the rocks and then
up the mountainside, their movements being hastened
by a bullet that hit the rocks between them
as they fled. In the meanwhile the remaining
wolves had also taken their departure.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the coast was now clear, the boys
swam across the arm of the lake. As they did
this they saw a somewhat elderly man approaching
on horseback, his rifle in his hands. He was
a tall man with a short-cut black beard and he
wore a miner’s outfit.</p>

<p>“Reckon I come just about in time,” he sang
out as he watched the approach of the boys.
“Didn’t think any timber wolves would attack
you like that.” And then he replaced the empty
cartridges in the magazine rifle with fresh ones
and waited for the lads to come up.</p>

<p>“It was fine of you to arrive as you did,” sang
out Jack, who was the first out of the water.
“We were caught good and plenty with our guns
over in our outfits yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“Where do you belong? I don’t think I ever
saw you before,” said the miner, as he dismounted.
Then he added quickly: “You ain’t
them Rover boys, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, now, ain’t that great!” and the miner
began to grin broadly. “Bet you a dollar you
don’t know who I am.”</p>

<p>“We know you’re our friend,” came quickly
from Fred.</p>

<p>“I’m Lew Billings,” answered the miner. “I
guess Mr. Tom Rover has talked about me.”</p>

<p>“Lew Billings!” gasped all of the boys in concert.</p>

<p>“That’s it! And I’m downright glad I got here
just in time to take care of them timber wolves
for you. That one yonder is as dead as a doornail,
and I don’t think them others will bother
you again for a while. You see, timber wolves
has been multiplying most amazing in Canada,
and they’ve got so thick they’re slipping all over
us down here. There’s a bounty on killing ’em,
but what it is I don’t just know.”</p>

<p>“But where have you been, Mr. Billings?”
questioned Randy. “My dad has been looking
all over for you.”</p>

<p>“I know it, lad. But I had to lay low. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
had a good reason for doing it, too. Your father
will know all about it as soon as I reach him.
I understand he’s stopping with Cal Corning.”</p>

<p>“He is,” put in Andy. And then he went on:
“From what Hank Butts said, my dad thought
you might have been made a prisoner by Mr.
Garrish.”</p>

<p>“So I was. And Garrish wanted me to sign
some reports that was all false. I wouldn’t do
it, and I got away from him and since that time
I’ve been spying on him and on them fellers
who’re running the Bigwater crusher. I’ve got
a lot to tell Mr. Rover when I see him. And
I’ve got an account to settle with Peter Garrish,
too,” went on the old miner.</p>

<p>The boys dressed, and while so doing Lew
Billings gave them a few particulars of what
had happened to him. But he was in a hurry
to go on and left them as soon as he felt satisfied
that they were now able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>“As you’ve all been to a military academy you
ought to know how to shoot,” he declared. “And
as you’ve got your guns and also a couple of
pistols with you, it ain’t likely that you’ll have
any more trouble—especially if you keep your
firearms handy. You don’t want to prowl around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
in these mountains without some kind of a gun.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, you won’t catch us without our
guns again,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Even when I sleep I’m going to have a pistol
under my pillow,” added Randy.</p>

<p>They thanked Lew Billings heartily for what
he had done and then watched the old miner as
he rode away on Sunset Trail in the direction of
Gold Hill Falls.</p>

<p>“If you ask me, I’ll say he was a friend in need
if ever there was one,” declared the young major.
“I don’t know what we’d have done if he
hadn’t come along.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be a lesson to us to be on our
guard,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“Now I am armed, oh, how I’d love to get
a shot at those wolves!” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>“What about the horses?” questioned Randy.
“We’ve got to find those animals. I think the
quicker we get after them the better. If they’re
allowed to stay away all night there’s no telling
if we’ll ever be able to round ’em up.”</p>

<p>But rounding up the four horses proved easier
than expected. None of them had gone away
any great distance. Two of them were found
on Sunset Trail just above the lake and the others
in the bushes on the mountainside. They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
rather difficult to handle for a few minutes, but
presently calmed down when spoken to soothingly.</p>

<p>The boys did not know exactly what to do
with the lean gray wolf that had been laid low
by Billings’s bullet. At first they thought to skin
the animal and save the pelt. But the hair was
poor at this time of year, and none of the boys
relished the labor, so they simply dragged the
carcass down the lake shore for a distance, and
then threw it in an opening between the rocks.</p>

<p>By nightfall the boys had erected their little
shelter and had a campfire going, and all did their
share in preparing the evening meal and in cleaning
the dishes afterward.</p>

<p>“Wonder what will happen to-night,” said
Randy, as they turned in, thoroughly tired out
over the happenings of the day. “Maybe we’ll
see more wolves, or a mountain lion or a bear.”</p>

<p>None of them cared to admit it, yet each was
a trifle nervous, thinking that possibly the timber
wolves might return. But nothing came to disturb
them, and, having made sure that their campfire
would not set fire to the forest around them,
one after another fell asleep and slumbered
soundly until after sunrise.</p>

<p>The next day proved to be one of unalloyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
pleasure for all the boys. In the morning they
went fishing and managed to get a good-sized
catch. In the afternoon they tramped through
the forest and there managed to bag several
squirrels and also a somewhat larger animal which
none of them could name.</p>

<p>“I thought we’d strike a bear, or something
like that,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“I guess you want too much,” answered Fred,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The boys returned to camp while it was still
light. All were hungry and immediately set to
work to clean some of the fish for supper. They
were hard at work at this when they saw a man
on horseback riding rapidly toward them.</p>

<p>“That man acts as if he wanted to see us in
a hurry,” said Jack, as he straightened up and
watched the fellow’s approach.</p>

<p>The man was a stranger to them and eyed
them inquiringly as he came closer.</p>

<p>“Are you the Rovers?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“We are,” answered Jack. “What of it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got bad news for you,” was the man’s
answer. “Mr. Tom Rover has been seriously
hurt, and the other fellows think you had better
come to see him just as soon as possible.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LOG CABIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“My dad hurt!”</p>

<p>The cry came simultaneously from Andy and
Randy.</p>

<p>“What happened to him?” questioned Fred and
Jack.</p>

<p>“His horse stumbled on the down trail and
threw Mr. Rover over his head,” answered the
man. “I don’t know but he may have his skull
cracked. Some miners picked him up and took
him to Longnose’s shack.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Indian called Longnose?”
queried Randy, for the boys had heard of such
an individual living along Sunset Trail. He was
an old man and quite a notorious character, and
the lads had thought that some time they might
visit him.</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow. They put Mr. Rover to
bed and sent one of the men off for a doctor.
He was unconscious for a while, but then he
began to call out for his sons and for Jack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
and Fred. One of the men knew about you being
in this vicinity and said you were stopping
with Cal Corning. So then I rode over to Corning’s
place. He wasn’t home, but the women
folks there told me that you were on a camping
trip and that I could find you either at Dogberry
Lake or Gansen Lake. I rode over to Dogberry
first, and then I came here. My name is Nick
Ocker. I’m from Allways.”</p>

<p>“Will you take us over to my dad?” questioned
Andy.</p>

<p>“Sure, I will. I told the other fellows that
I’d come back with you. They thought if they
couldn’t get the doctor they might get some sort
of a wagon and move Mr. Rover over to Allways.
He’s west of here, and it would be easier traveling
that way than this. The road is better going.
Besides that, we’ve got two doctors over there,
and one of them, Doc Hendershot, runs a kind
of hospital.”</p>

<p>The sad news that the twins’ father had been
seriously hurt worried the boys greatly. The
twins were the most affected and so worked up
they could scarcely prepare themselves for the
trip.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! suppose he dies?” burst out Andy
frantically.</p>

<p>“Oh, it may not be so bad, Andy,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
young major soothingly. “First reports are often
ten times worse than they ought to be.”</p>

<p>“But if he’s got a fractured skull——” put in
Randy, and then choked up so he could not go on.</p>

<p>The boys could think of but one thing, and that
was to get to Tom Rover’s side as quickly as
possible. Kicking the campfire into the lake so
that the blaze might do no damage during their
absence, they ran for their horses and were soon
mounted. In their hurry to get away they forgot
almost everything else, although just before leaping
into the saddle Fred grabbed up one of the
pistols and Jack the other.</p>

<p>The horse on which Nick Ocker was mounted
showed signs of having been ridden a considerable
distance. Yet he got over Sunset Trail at
a fairly good rate of speed, although to the boys,
anxious to get to Tom Rover’s side, it seemed
almost a snail’s pace.</p>

<p>“If we were only sure where this Longnose’s
cabin was located we could go ahead,” said Randy.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” breathed his brother, clattering
along beside his twin over the rocky trail.
“Gee, if only we had an auto and could use it!”</p>

<p>“If dad is seriously hurt what are we going
to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose it will depend on
circumstances. It’s too bad there isn’t some city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
near by where we could get a first-class doctor
and maybe put dad in a real hospital. That’s
most likely what he’ll need.”</p>

<p>Up one foothill and down another passed the
Rover boys and their guide. Then Sunset Trail
made a sharp turn and they found themselves
climbing the mountainside. Here the going was
exceedingly rough, and they had to ride with
care. Then they reached the top of the rise and
went downward, still hugging the mountainside.</p>

<p>“I reckon it was somewhere along here that
the other fellows picked Mr. Rover up,” observed
Nick Ocker as they clattered along, occasionally
sending a loose stone down into the rocky valley
below them. “It’s a mighty bad place to get a
tumble, if you want to know it.”</p>

<p>“Did he break any bones, do you know?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me one of his wrists acted that
way,” answered Ocker. “It was very limp and
swollen. But, of course, Mr. Rover was hurt
too badly around the head to tell anything about
it. He’s got a bad bruise on his left shoulder
too. I don’t like to alarm you boys, but I think
he’ll be mighty lucky if he pulls out of it.”</p>

<p>“How far have we to go now?” questioned
Randy. He had asked the same question several
times before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“Not more than half a mile,” was the reply
of the guide.</p>

<p>Nick Ocker was not a prepossessing individual
when it came to looks. He was tall, gaunt, and
had several scars on the side of his face and on
his neck. He had bulging black eyes that seemed
at times to almost pop out of his head, and a
crop of black hair that was almost as stiff as a
brush. He was rather poorly dressed, showing
that he was most likely down on his luck.</p>

<p>But just now the boys paid little attention to
their guide except to follow him on the trail.
Their thoughts were centered upon their relative
who had been hurt. In what condition would
they find him? Was he still alive?</p>

<p>Presently they reached a split in the roadway.
Sunset Trail continued westward and a smaller
trail headed along the mountainside to the
north.</p>

<p>“There is Longnose’s cabin!” exclaimed Nick
Ocker, pointing ahead. “And there is one of
the fellows waving to us to come on.”</p>

<p>The place he pointed out was an old and dilapidated
log cabin built, evidently, by some prospector
years ago. It stood in the shadow of a
clump of fir trees and on one side was an immense
rock resting precariously close to the edge of a
sharp cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“Are those the Rover boys?” sang out the man
in front of the cabin, as the party came up.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nick Ocker. “How is Mr.
Rover?”</p>

<p>“Not so well,” was the reply. “He’s been asking
for his two sons and the others right along.
But listen,” went on the man. “You chaps want
to go in there cautiously. The doctor was here
and said Mr. Rover was not to be excited.”</p>

<p>Hastily dismounting, the four boys entered the
log cabin, and as they did so the two men outside
led the horses away. Then several other
men appeared, each with his soft hat pulled far
down over his forehead.</p>

<p>“Make it short and snappy,” said one of the
men to all of the others. “Don’t take any chances.
If you give ’em any rope they’ll fight like wildcats.”</p>

<p>“I’m all ready,” answered one of the other men.
He was carrying a number of ropes.</p>

<p>One after another the boys entered the log
cabin. It was rather dark inside, and for several
seconds they could see little or nothing. Then
they saw a bunk on the far side of the room and
on it rested a form partly covered with a blanket.
The head of the form was swathed in bandages.
With their hearts in their throats Andy and
Randy approached what they thought was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
form of their father, and Fred and Jack followed.
Then, as they were bending over the form in the
bunk, they heard hasty footsteps behind them.
The next instant each of them found his arms
pinned behind him.</p>

<p>“Take it easy now! Take it easy or you’ll
be sorry for it!” cried one of the men in a hard
voice.</p>

<p>“If you try to fight you’ll get the worst licking
you ever had in all your life,” added another of
the men.</p>

<p>“Wha-what does this mean?” stammered
Randy. The sudden turn of affairs completely
bewildered him.</p>

<p>“Dad! Dad!” came from Andy, who in a flash
thought his father might be the victim of foul
play at the hands of the men who were now attacking
them.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet there—keep quiet!” ordered one
of the men who was holding Jack.</p>

<p>But the young major had no intention of submitting
calmly to the unexpected attack that had
been made on him and his cousins. Like a lightning
flash it came to him that they were the victims
of a trap, and his astonishment was increased
when he saw that the man who was holding him
was Carson Davenport!</p>

<p>“I told you I’d get you some day, you rat!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
cried Davenport between his set teeth. “I’ve
waited a long time, but now I’ve got you!” and
still holding Jack he did his best to bind the young
major’s hands behind him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the other boys were struggling
with might and main to get away from the
rascals who were holding them. Half a dozen
blows were struck, and poor Fred was dragged
outside by two of the men and tightly bound,
hands and feet. Andy presently followed, and
then the whole gang of men set upon Randy and
Jack. They continued to fight until each received
a blow on the head that all but stunned him.
Then they, too, were roped up.</p>

<p>In the mêlée in the cabin Randy and his assailant
had lunged against the bunk where the figure
supposed to be that of Tom Rover rested. In
the mix-up the figure fell out on the floor and
proved to be nothing but a crudely made dummy.</p>

<p>When the boys recovered somewhat from the
effects of the unexpected attack they were surprised
to find themselves confronted, not only by
Carson Davenport, but also by Tate and Jackson,
Davenport’s cronies in the oil fields. The other
two men were a fellow named Digby and the
guide who had brought them to the ill-fated spot.</p>

<p>“Well, that trick worked to perfection,” said
Davenport, as he eyed the four prisoners with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
satisfaction. “Now then, Ocker, tell us just how
you worked it.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Ocker related how he had gone
directly to Gansen Lake and told his faked story
of Tom Rover’s mishap. He had not been near
Cal Corning’s home, for the reason that the crowd
had already information regarding the movements
of the younger Rovers.</p>

<p>“I think the best thing you can do, Ocker, is
to go back to that camp and bring all of the duffel
up here. Take Digby with you. Make it look
as if the boys had been there and then moved
on to some other place. That will set Tom Rover
to guessing and give us a chance to make a clean
get-away.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve captured us, what do you intend
to do with us?” questioned Jack. The blood
was flowing down one of his cheeks, but he had
no means of wiping it away.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out a little later,” answered Davenport.</p>

<p>“You kids are responsible for our dropping a
lot of money down in the oil fields,” came from
Jackson, with a sour look at the Rovers. “We
calculate to get some of that money back.”</p>

<p>“Nothing happened to you but what you deserved,”
retorted Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s your way of looking at it. We think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
differently,” growled Tate, and then he added:
“We might as well be on the way. Longnose
will be back here to-night most likely, and we’ll
want to clean up before he comes.”</p>

<p>Bound as they were, the boys were helpless.
One after another they were lashed fast to their
horses and then the men brought forth their own
steeds. The log cabin was put in order, the
door closed, and the whole party rode off, Jackson
in advance and Davenport bringing up the
rear. Between them rode the four boys and Tate.
All of the men carried guns, and Davenport had
the pistol taken from Jack while Tate carried
the one Fred had brought along.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty glad of one thing,” said
Randy to his twin, as they rode along a narrow
trail leading into the mountains. “I’m glad that
figure in the bunk was a dummy and not dad.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered his brother quickly.
“Gee! when I think of that story being a fake
I’m almost satisfied to be a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can’t ride away from them,”
whispered the other.</p>

<p>“What! with all of them carrying guns? I’m
afraid not. They could easily shoot our horses,
even if they didn’t want to shoot us.”</p>

<p>The boys, bruised and bleeding from the atrocious
attack made upon them, thought the ride<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
along the mountainside would never come to an
end. The horses had to proceed with care, for
the rocky trail was full of perils, and before the
ride came to an end Fred was so dizzy and weak
he could hardly see. Randy’s back hurt him, and
he would have given almost anything just to lie
down.</p>

<p>Presently they reached a place where the underbrush
among the trees was heavy. Here the
whole party came to a halt and the men dismounted.
One after another the boys were unlashed
and the ropes binding their feet were released.
Then, somewhat to their surprise, they
were led into a long, low cave shaped somewhat
like a dumb-bell with a narrow opening in the
center. At this opening some rough timbers had
been placed, held securely by several chains. At
one side one of the timbers could be pushed away,
forming something of a door.</p>

<p>“Now then, in you go!” cried Davenport, and
one after another the lads were thrust into the
back section of the cavern. Then the log door
was pushed again into position and chained, and
the four Rover boys found themselves prisoners
in the cave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<small>THREE DEMANDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On the morning following the capture of the
four Rover boys, Miss Jennie Corning, on getting
up to prepare breakfast for her brother and
Tom Rover, was much surprised to find a letter
that had been thrust under the front door of the
house.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, it’s a letter for Mr. Rover!”
she exclaimed to herself. “I wonder why they
didn’t knock? Perhaps they thought we were all
asleep and didn’t want to wake us up.”</p>

<p>She heard Tom stirring in his room, and, going
to it, knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“A letter for you,” she said as he peered out
through a crack. “I found it shoved under the
front door.”</p>

<p>On the day previous Tom Rover had received
telegrams from both Mr. Renton and Mr. Parkhurst
stating that they were with him in his actions
against Peter Garrish and that they would
come to Gold Hill as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe Garrish has got wind of what I’m up
to and wants to head me off,” thought Tom as
he sat down on a chair by the window and opened
the communication.</p>

<p>He read the letter hastily and then uttered a
low whistle as he read it a second time. The
communication ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You and your family have done a whole lot toward
placing us in a hole. Now we intend to get square. We
have your twin sons and the other two boys prisoners a long
distance from here. They are in a spot where you will never
be able to find them. If you ever expect to see your twins
alive again be prepared to pay us fifty thousand dollars in
cash. This is a first notice so that you can get the money
together and have it ready. You will soon receive another
notice as to how the money is to be paid. Do not try to
put the authorities on our track or you will regret it as long
as you live.</p>

<p class="noi pad75p">“<span class="smcap">Davenport.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Jackson.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Tate.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>It would be hard to analyze poor Tom’s feeling
when he had ascertained the contents of the
letter. The news that the boys were prisoners
of their enemies upset him fully as much as the
boys had been upset when they had been told the
twins’ father was injured.</p>

<p>“Dick was right, after all!” he groaned. “I
thought he was overcautious when he had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
women folks and the girls taken away. But he
was right. Davenport must have been up around
Colby Hall and Clearwater Hall for the express
purpose of getting his hands on the boys, and
the girls too. It was a deep-laid plot, no doubt
of it. And that being so, they have probably
done everything they could to cover up their
tracks.”</p>

<p>What to do Tom hardly knew. He dressed
with all possible haste and then went to talk the
matter over with Cal Corning, who had not been
away from home, as Nick Ocker had told the
boys.</p>

<p>“It’s a villainous piece of business,” was Corning’s
comment. “Why, those rascals have kidnaped
the lads! They ought every one of them
to be shot down!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” answered Tom. “But
first we’ve got to find them. You told them to
go to a place called Gansen Lake, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s one of the finest spots in this vicinity
for camping out.”</p>

<p>“Then I think I’d better ride over there and
try to find out what happened,” went on the twins’
father. “I’d like you to come along.”</p>

<p>“I sure will, Mr. Rover. And we’ll take guns
along too—we may need ’em,” went on Cal
Corning, an angry look in his eyes. “I hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
we can round those rascals up. Things have been
pretty peaceable like in this county, and we want
’em to continue that way. We don’t harbor no
bandits nor kidnapers either.”</p>

<p>Tom waited until Cal Corning had swallowed
a hasty breakfast. For himself, he managed to
drink a cup of coffee at the earnest solicitation
of Miss Jennie and Miss Lucy, both of whom
were highly excited over what was taking place.
Then the two men rode off toward Lake Gansen.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter for Corning to locate the
spot where the four boys had camped. On the
edge of the lake they found the remains of the
campfire, and, searching the vicinity, came upon
a handkerchief bearing Fred’s initials. But
everything was gone, for Ocker and Digby had
taken the things away the evening before.</p>

<p>Cal Corning was a thorough backwoodsman
and after a careful search declared that all of
the horses had passed up to Sunset Trail. They
followed the hoofmarks for a short distance, but
soon lost them where the trail became rocky.</p>

<p>It was long after dark before Tom Rover returned
to the Corning homestead. Cal had preceded
him, but Tom had been loath to give up
the hunt for the missing ones. He had found
absolutely no trace of the boys, and he was increasingly
dispirited. For the time being all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
thoughts concerning Peter Garrish and his doings
were forgotten.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do something,” muttered Tom to
himself. “I’ve simply got to do something!”
But what to do he did not know. He started
another hunt the next day, and then, being equally
unsuccessful in getting a trace of the four boys,
rode over to Maporah and sent a long telegram
to his two brothers.</p>

<p>The telegram was delivered to Dick Rover at
the home on Riverside Drive in New York just
at a time when Dick and Sam were so excited
they could scarcely contain themselves.</p>

<p>And their excitement was justified, for while
the two men had been eating dinner in Dick’s
home, a messenger had appeared at the front door
with two communications, one addressed to Dick
and the other to his younger brother. Each of
the two letters was similar to that sent to Tom
Rover. In the one addressed to Dick the three
rascals, Davenport, Jackson and Tate, demanded
fifty thousand dollars for the safe return of Jack,
while in the communication addressed to Sam
the same amount of money was demanded for the
safe return of Fred. Completely bewildered by
these letters the two men had been discussing the
situation when the telegram from Tom was
brought in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>“Poor Tom is in the same boat!” exclaimed
Sam. “Those scoundrels want fifty thousand
dollars from him or they won’t return the twins.”</p>

<p>“That means that Tate, Jackson and Davenport
want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars from
us for the safe return of the four boys,” came
from Dick. “It’s a pretty stiff demand, I take
it.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to pay it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can possibly help it. Fifty thousand
dollars isn’t a flea bite. At the same time, I
don’t want them to hurt Jack or the other boys.
I know Davenport and his crowd pretty well.
They are about as hard-boiled as they come. I
suppose the gang are as mad as hornets at me
and the kids for the way we turned the tables on
them down in the oil fields.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe in giving them a cent,
either,” said Sam. “Just the same, it makes me
shiver to think of what they might do to Fred
if I don’t pony up.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something, that’s sure.” Dick
Rover began to pace up and down the floor. “I
expect Tom is just as much worried as we are.
It was an outrage to let Davenport and those
other fellows out of prison, and this proves it.
I’ll tell you what, Sam. I’d give a good part of
that fifty thousand dollars right now to get my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
hands on Davenport,” and Dick’s eyes sparked
angrily.</p>

<p>From the servant girl they learned that the
message had been delivered by a boy. Who the
fellow was she did not know, nor could she give
a very good description of his appearance.</p>

<p>“I suppose he was a kid just hired for the
occasion,” said Dick. “Most likely he knew nothing
about the fellow who gave him the letters.”
And in this surmise Jack’s father was correct.</p>

<p>The two talked the matter over for half an
hour and then Dick telephoned to a telegraph
station and sent a telegram to Tom stating he
was starting for Maporah immediately and that
Sam would probably follow in a day or two.</p>

<p>“Somebody will have to go down to the office
in the morning,” said Dick. “I’ll take the midnight
train for Chicago. You can follow just
as soon as you can fix things up in Wall Street,”
and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>Although he did not know it, Dick Rover’s
departure for the Grand Central Terminal was
noted by a young man who was watching the
three Rover houses from the other side of Riverside
Drive. This person was none other than
the fellow who had introduced himself to the
Rover boys as Joe Brooks. And it was Brooks,
acting on information sent to him by telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
by Davenport, who had made the demands in
the letters received by Dick and Sam.</p>

<p>“Going West, eh?” muttered Brooks to himself,
after he saw Dick on his way on the midnight
limited. “I’ll have to let Davenport know
about this,” and he immediately forwarded a
cipher dispatch. Then he returned to the vicinity
of the Rover homes to learn if possible what
Sam Rover intended to do.</p>

<p>He remained around the vicinity for more than
an hour, then returned to his hotel to snatch a
few hours’ sleep. But he was up by seven o’clock
and once more on the watch, and he followed Sam
down into Wall Street and at noon saw Sam also
depart for Maporah. Then he sent an additional
dispatch to Davenport.</p>

<p>“I think I might as well go out West myself
now,” he told himself after the dispatch had been
forwarded. “There is no use of letting Davenport
and that crowd get their fists on one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars when I’m not
around. If I’m not on hand they may forget
all the work I’ve done on the case. I’m entitled
to my full share of whatever comes in, and I intend
to have it.” A few hours later he too
departed for the West, getting a ticket for Allways.
He traveled as he was as far as Chicago.
But there, before changing to the other train,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
he donned the costume of a Westerner and put on
a wig of sandy gray hair which made him look
considerably older than he was.</p>

<p>Although he had not said a word to anybody
about it, Dick Rover carried with him on his
Western trip the equivalent of seventy-five thousand
dollars, part in cash and part in Liberty
Bonds. When Sam left the city at noon the
day following he carried a like amount of cash
and securities, the two sums making the total of
the amount demanded by the rascals who were
holding the four boys for ransom.</p>

<p>“If the worst comes to the worst, we’ll have
to pony up and let it go at that,” was the way
Dick had expressed himself before leaving. “Just
the same, I hope we won’t have to give up a cent,
and that we can catch those rascals red-handed.”</p>

<p>Dick hoped greatly that Tom would have good
news for him on his arrival. But he was doomed
to disappointment. Tom rode over to the Maporah
station to meet his brother, and one look
at his face told Dick that so far the hunt for the
missing boys had proved fruitless.</p>

<p>“I’m keeping the thing as quiet as possible,”
said Tom, whose eyes showed that he had slept
but little the past few nights. “But I’ve got Cal
Corning, Hank Butts, Lew Billings, and half a
dozen other men hunting high and low for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
boys. So far though they haven’t turned up the
slightest clew, and I haven’t been able to get a
clew myself, although I’ve been riding up and
down one trail and another and making inquiries
of every one I met. Not a soul seems to have
seen them since they were at Lake Gansen.”</p>

<p>“Have you received any more letters?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“No. But I’m expecting one every day. Those
fellows are probably as anxious as we are.
They’ll want to get their money and most likely
get out of the country—maybe going down into
Mexico where we can’t get at them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, Tom, that you haven’t got
more word,” and now Dick’s face showed deeper
anxiety than ever. “Those fellows may have got
cold feet on the whole proposition and done away
with the boys.”</p>

<p>“That may be so, Dick,” and Tom’s voice took
on a tone of hopelessness. “I wouldn’t put it past
Davenport and that gang to do anything. I
only pray to Heaven that the boys may still be
alive.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<small>PRISONERS IN THE CAVE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile, what of the four Rover boys
and their captors?</p>

<p>Bruised and bleeding, the lads had been thrown
into the rear part of the stony cavern, as already
mentioned. The ropes which had bound them
had been taken away, but they were prisoners
behind heavy logs kept in place by strong
chains.</p>

<p>Fred was so weak he was unable for the time
being to stand, and so slipped down in a heap
in a corner with his back against a big stone.
There Andy followed him, nursing a wounded
shoulder where he had been struck with a club.
Randy and Jack had also suffered, the former
having one arm severely wrenched in the mêlée
at Longnose’s cabin and the young major suffering
from several cuts on the forehead and on
his chin.</p>

<p>“Now then, you boys behave yourselves and
rest a while, and then we’ll have a talk,” announced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
Davenport, and he and his gang went
outside, leaving the boys alone.</p>

<p>It was rather dark in the cavern, the only light
coming from the entrance, which was partly
screened by the bushes, and from a small crack
overhead. This crack served to ventilate the
place, there being a continual current of air from
the opening in front to that above.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the four boys felt
anything but happy as they peered at their surroundings.
All were too fatigued from the forced
ride over the rocky trail to do much talking.
They gathered in a group on the stony floor of
the cave, trying to attend to their cuts and bruises
as well as their limited means permitted.</p>

<p>“Gee, if a fellow only had a bit of water!” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“They are a bunch of beasts!” cried Randy.</p>

<p>“They have certainly made us prisoners,” said
Jack grimly. “Evidently they fixed this place on
purpose for us.”</p>

<p>“Certainly looks it,” came from Andy. “Gee,
it’s just like a regular prison! Not much chance
of getting away from here, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>A little later Tate came in carrying two buckets
of water and two towels. He was followed by
Jackson, who unlocked the chain holding the log
of the doorway in place, so that the water and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
towels might be placed inside of the prison-like
apartment. The men had a lantern with them,
and this they placed on a flat stone.</p>

<p>“There is one bucket to wash in and another
for drinking,” said Tate. “And here are a couple
of towels you can use on your hurts. We didn’t
mean to treat you quite so rough, and it wouldn’t
have happened if you hadn’t put up a fight.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with us, Tate?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out a little later. Davenport will
come in and talk with you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve made another demand on
our folks for money,” declared Randy.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head about that now,” put
in Jackson. “Better have a drink and wash up.
Then you’ll feel better.” Thereupon the two men
placed the log of the doorway in position, adjusted
the chain, and left the cave.</p>

<p>The boys were glad to get the water and likewise
the use of the lantern. Each washed in turn
and took a drink, and then all felt somewhat
better. But their long tramp through the woods
that afternoon, the ride to Longnose’s cabin, and
then the ride to the cave had made all of them
exceedingly hungry.</p>

<p>“Wonder if they’re going to give us anything
to eat,” remarked Fred after the light from outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
had faded, leaving only the lantern to light
the cavern.</p>

<p>“I hardly think they intend to starve us,” replied
Jack. “Those fellows are out for only one
thing—money.”</p>

<p>The young major was right in regard to being
starved, and less than an hour later Tate and
Digby appeared carrying a pot of stew, another
of coffee, and a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>“It’s the best we can do to-night,” said Tate,
grinning. “Perhaps to-morrow we’ll have something
better.”</p>

<p>“Then you intend to keep us prisoners?” demanded
Jack.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know you’ll get yourselves into hot
water doing that, Tate?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we know what we’re doing, Rover.”</p>

<p>“If you kids will only behave yourselves you’ll
be treated fine,” put in Digby. “We don’t want
to hurt you. All we expect to do is to keep you
here for maybe a week at the most. As soon
as your folks come across we’ll let you go.”</p>

<p>“And suppose they don’t come across?” questioned
Fred.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>Once more the Rover boys were left to themselves.
The men had brought with them four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
tin plates, four cups, and the necessary knives,
forks and spoons, and the lads lost no time in
attacking the simple meal which had been furnished
them.</p>

<p>“This must have been a well-prepared plan of
theirs,” was Andy’s comment while they were
eating. “They’ve even got tableware for us, and
towels.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager Davenport’s had this planned ever
since he went to Haven Point,” returned Jack.
“Perhaps he thought he could get hold of us or a
hold of the girls while we were there. And since
I’ve been here thinking things over I’ve got another
idea,” went on the young major slowly.
“I may be all wrong, but somehow I can’t get
it out of my mind.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that fellow who was in
the runabout with Davenport the day we met
them on the road near Colby Hall?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Well, ever since we met that fellow named
Joe Brooks first in New York and afterward in
Chicago I’ve been trying to figure out where I saw
the chap. Now I’m wondering if he wasn’t the
fellow who was driving that car.”</p>

<p>“Why, he said he was a friend of Fatty
Hendry’s!” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, he said so. But that doesn’t make it so,
does it?”</p>

<p>“You think he was a faker?” came quickly
from Randy.</p>

<p>“He was if he was in cahoots with Davenport.
Do you remember how he stood alongside of us
when we were buying our tickets for Maporah,
and how he questioned us about Sunset Trail
when we were going around with him in Chicago?
He must have been nothing but a confederate of
Davenport and his gang.” And in this surmise,
as we already know, Jack was correct.</p>

<p>Although the bread was somewhat stale, the
stew and the coffee were both warm and fairly
good, and, all told, the boys managed to satisfy
their hunger. They were wondering what was
going to happen next when Jackson and Digby
came in carrying four blankets.</p>

<p>“No feather beds for you kids to-night,” said
Digby. “But I reckon you’ll find these a good
deal better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“Davenport told me to tell you he’d have a
talk with you in the morning,” put in Jackson.
“Now don’t try to break out and get away, because
one of us will be on guard in front of the
cave all night. Whoever is there will be armed
and ready to shoot if you try any monkey business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“Have you got a camp near by?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes; we’re right where we can keep our eyes
on you.”</p>

<p>The men went out and once more the four
Rovers were left to themselves. Jack and Randy
now felt better, and while the latter took up the
lantern the young major made a careful inspection
of the walls of the cavern.</p>

<p>This inspection was disappointing. There were
several nooks and angles in the back of the cave
and one large crack and several small ones, all
leading upward. But nothing in the way of an
opening large enough to admit the passage of the
body was revealed.</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely that those fellows would leave
any loophole for us,” remarked Randy, as he
held up the lantern. “They probably went over
this place very carefully before they set those
logs up and chained them.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s true,” was Jack’s answer.
“But I’m going to get out of here somehow if I
possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I guess we all want to get away if
it can be done, Jack.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t get away soon those rascals will
hold our dads up for thousands and thousands of
dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“I know that, too. But we’re not going to be
able to get away if this prison is secure, and if
they’re going to set a guard to watch us. For
all you know, they may be listening to every word
we’re saying.”</p>

<p>As tired and worn out as they were, Andy and
Fred also took a look around the rocky prison.
But nothing new was brought to light, and presently
all four of the boys were too tired to do
more. They arranged their blankets as best they
could, and then sank down to rest. But it was
a long while before any of them fell asleep. Jack
was the last to drop off, and he turned the lantern
low just before doing so in order not to waste
the oil, for there was no telling if any more
would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>When the four boys arose in the morning each
felt in anything but an agreeable humor. All
were stiff and lame and it is doubtful if any of
them could have run very far even had the chance
offered. They had expected a visit from Davenport,
but much to their surprise that individual
failed to show himself. Instead Tate and Ocker
brought them a breakfast consisting of coffee,
bread, and some slices of bacon.</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t let you out in the sunshine,”
said Tate. “But if you behave yourselves to-day
maybe we’ll let you out to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“Is Davenport in command here?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“He’s our leader, yes.”</p>

<p>“Tell him I want to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone off and he won’t be back until this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>After that the hours dragged by more slowly
than ever. The boys chafed under the restraint
but could not think of a single thing to do to
better their condition.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can’t push some of those logs
apart and squeeze through the opening somehow,”
whispered Fred after the breakfast had been disposed
of. “Maybe some of the chains are not
as tight as they look.”</p>

<p>With the coming of day the light in the cave
had grown brighter. With this, and also the lantern
to aid them, the four lads set to work and
examined the logs and the chains minutely. As
they did this they watched the opening to the
cave so that no one might notice what they were
doing. But none of the gang that had made
them captives appeared.</p>

<p>At first the case looked hopeless and the boys
were filled with despair. But then Andy noticed
where one of the chains seemed to have slipped
down over a notch in one of the logs. This was
pried up and by their united efforts the boys were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
finally able to move the top of one of the logs a
distance of six or eight inches.</p>

<p>“There! I’m sure that opening is wide enough
to let a fellow out,” declared Fred. “Anyhow,
I am sure I could get through it.”</p>

<p>“We could all get through if we could get up
there,” returned Jack. The widened opening between
the logs was a foot or two above his head.</p>

<p>It was here that their gymnastic exercises stood
the boys in good stead. Jack quickly managed to
place himself on Randy’s shoulders and then
squeezed his way through the opening between
the logs. Fred and Andy followed, and then
those outside gave Randy a hand up, and presently
all four of the lads stood outside of what
had been their prison.</p>

<p>“Now what shall we do—make a rush for it?”
whispered Fred.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I’ll see how the land lies,”
announced the young major, and while the others
waited he crawled cautiously to the entrance of
the cave and peered out between the bushes.</p>

<p>The others waited with bated breath wondering
what would happen next. Half a minute
passed and then Jack tiptoed his way back to his
cousins.</p>

<p>“Tate and Jackson are out there, smoking their
pipes and resting on the ground,” he announced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
“Each has a gun handy. They are about fifty
feet from the entrance to the cave.”</p>

<p>“Are they looking this way?” asked Randy.</p>

<p>“Yes, both are facing the entrance to the cave.”</p>

<p>“Have they got their guns in their hands?”
questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“No, their guns are resting against a tree near
by.”</p>

<p>“Then why can’t we make a dash for it?” asked
Andy recklessly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ll have to do that,” answered
the young major. “I’ve got another plan.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<small>TRYING TO ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In a whisper so that the two men outside of
the cave might not hear him, Jack outlined his
plan for escape.</p>

<p>“The bushes on the left of the entrance are
very thick and extend outside for ten or fifteen
feet. There are also several bushes just in front
of the entrance that are a foot or more high.
If we can crawl out in snake fashion maybe we
can get into those bushes and work our way
along until we reach some spot where we shall
be out of line of their vision. Then, as soon
as we get that far, we can leg it for all we are
worth.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, Jack, I hope we can do it!” returned
Randy. “Come on, let’s try at once. Those fellows
may take it into their heads to come into
the cave any time.”</p>

<p>All were more than willing to make the attempt
to escape, even though they realized that the men
watching them were desperate characters and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
would not hesitate to use their firearms if they
thought it necessary.</p>

<p>The four boys approached the entrance of the
cave with caution, dropping flat on their stomachs
as they did so. Then, led by Jack, one after
another wormed his way along until the bushes
screening the opening were reached.</p>

<p>“Now be careful,” warned Jack. “Don’t shake
the bushes too much or those men will get suspicious.
It may pay to go slow. And don’t
make any noise.”</p>

<p>As silently as Indians on a hunt the four boys
began to worm their way through the bushes at
the side of the cave opening. This was no easy
task, for there was always danger of cracking
some dry twig or of shaking the tops of the
bushes unduly. They could hear the men talking
earnestly and even heard Jackson knock out his
pipe against a tree.</p>

<p>“As soon as I get my hands on the dough I’m
going to light out for Mexico,” they heard Jackson
tell Tate. “That’s the safest place to hide.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is,” they heard Tate answer. “But
I don’t like to live among those Greasers. I’ll
try my luck up in the Northwest. I don’t think
anybody will try to follow me to where I’m
going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think the Rovers will come across,
Tate?”</p>

<p>“Sure, they will! They’ll pay up to the last
dollar! Davenport will make ’em do it!”</p>

<p>“But suppose they balk?”</p>

<p>“Then Davenport will send ’em a finger or an
ear. That will surely bring ’em to terms mighty
quick.”</p>

<p>“Would he go as far as that?”</p>

<p>“Davenport? You don’t know the man! He’d
go a great deal further if he thought it would
bring him in any money. That fellow is about
as cold-blooded as they make ’em.”</p>

<p>Every one of the boys heard this talk, and it
made them feel anything but comfortable. Evidently
the scoundrels who had made them captives
would stop at nothing to accomplish their
ends.</p>

<p>Presently Jack found himself confronted by a
big rock that stuck up almost to the top of the
bushes. As silently as a cat after a bird, he
crawled over this rock, and one after another
the others followed. Then came a series of rocks
and more brushwood, and at last the four lads
found themselves out of sight of Tate and Jackson.</p>

<p>“Which way are you going to head?” questioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Randy when he thought it was safe to
speak.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the whispered reply.
“The main thing is to get out of reach of those
fellows. Come on—don’t lose any time. If they
discover our escape they’ll do their best to round
us up again.”</p>

<p>Without knowing where they were going, the
four boys plunged on through the bushes and
over the rough rocks until they came to a narrow
trail running along the mountainside.</p>

<p>“I think we’re heading for Sunset Trail,”
announced Fred. “And if we are, so much the
better.”</p>

<p>“If we see or hear anybody coming jump behind
the trees or bushes,” ordered Jack. “We
might run into Davenport. They said he had
gone off on some sort of an errand.”</p>

<p>The boys pushed on for several hundred feet,
and there found that the trail came to an end
at a spring of water which gushed forth from between
several rocks. Beyond this point was a
heavy mass of practically impenetrable forest.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look as if we could go any farther in
this direction,” remarked Andy, his face falling as
he gazed around.</p>

<p>“No. I guess we’ve got to go back,” answered
the young major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“Wait a second. I’m going to have a drink,”
cried Fred, and bent down to partake of the clear,
cool water of the spring.</p>

<p>All were thirsty, and they spent a full minute
in refreshing themselves. They were just turning
away from the spring when they heard a
shout followed presently by three gunshots in
rapid succession.</p>

<p>“They’ve discovered our escape and that’s a
signal to warn the others!” ejaculated Jack.
“Now we’ve got to be careful or they’ll catch
us sure.”</p>

<p>How to turn the boys did not know. They
could not go ahead, and they did not want to backtrack
on the trail for fear of running into some
of their enemies. To climb the mountainside was
practically impossible, and it looked almost as dangerous
to attempt to descend between the uncertain
rocks and dense brushwood.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s suicide to stay where we are,” was
the way Andy expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it,” added his twin.</p>

<p>“Unless I’m mistaken, I can see some sort of
a trail below us,” announced Jack. “Look there
and tell me if I am right.”</p>

<p>All gazed in the direction indicated and came
to the conclusion that there was another and
better trail about a hundred yards below them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
Then one after another they began the perilous
descent between the rocks and bushes.</p>

<p>All went well for a distance of sixty yards.
Then Randy slipped and his twin almost immediately
followed. Jack was ahead of them, and
in a twinkling they took the young major off
his feet. Fred made a wild clutch to stop Andy,
and as a consequence he, too, began to slide. All
of the boys went down with a rush, carrying
several small bushes with them. They slid over
the rocks and a number of loose stones, and
finally brought up in a hollow, some small stones
rattling all around them as they did so.</p>

<p>“Wow! Talk about your toboggans!” gasped
Randy, when he could speak. “I guess I came
down at the rate of half a mile a minute.”</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?” sang out Jack. He himself
had scratched his elbow, his ear and one of
his knees.</p>

<p>All of them were scratched and bumped, but
not seriously, and they stood up quickly, brushing
themselves off and gazing around to find out
where they had landed.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Jack, pointing. “If that isn’t
Sunset Trail over there then I miss my guess!
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“It sure is! And yonder is Longnose’s cabin,”
answered Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>“Out of sight! All of you!” came quickly
from Randy. “There is Davenport and a couple
of others with him!”</p>

<p>One after another the Rover boys tried to hide
behind such rocks and bushes as were available.
But their movements came to little. They were
discovered by one of the men with Davenport,
and that individual immediately set up a cry of
alarm. Then the men, led by Davenport, came
riding toward the spot as rapidly as the condition
of the trail permitted.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are!” yelled the man from
the oil fields. “Hands up and stop, or it will
be the worse for you!”</p>

<p>The boys heard the rascal but paid no attention
to his threat. They did their best to lose
themselves in some bushes below the spot where
they had landed. But the way was rough and
uncertain and one after another they took another
tumble, to find themselves at last hopelessly
tangled up in a mass of brushwood.</p>

<p>“You can’t get away from us, so you might
as well give up,” yelled Davenport as he rode
as close as the brushwood and rocks would permit.
“Come out of there one by one. If you
don’t, we’ll use our guns.”</p>

<p>Seeing that all of the men were armed, the
boys knew it would be useless to attempt to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
farther, and so one by one they came out of
the tangle of rocks and brushwood, their clothing
torn and their hands bleeding from their
rough experience. Fred was the first to emerge,
and, telling his companions to “keep all of the
rats covered,” Davenport dismounted and caught
the youngest Rover by the arm.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d get away, eh?” snorted the
oil man, an ugly look crossing his face. “I
reckon we let you have too much liberty. After
this I’ll see to it that you won’t get a yard from
where we place you.”</p>

<p>All of the boys did their best to argue with
Davenport, but the oil man would not listen to
them, and in the end they were compelled to
march along the trail as it wound in and out
along the mountainside, at last reaching a camp
close to where the cave in which they had been
prisoners was located. At the camp they fell in
with Tate and Jackson, who had been looking
everywhere for the lads.</p>

<p>“How did they get away?” stormed Davenport.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” answered Tate. “We haven’t
made an inspection of the cave yet. They must
have crawled through some kind of a hole.”</p>

<p>The cave was entered, and soon the rascals
discovered how two of the logs had been pried
apart at the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>“After this we’ll have to guard ’em! That’s
all there is to it!” declared Davenport. “Why,
if we hadn’t been lucky enough to spot ’em, they’d
have gotten away sure.”</p>

<p>“See here, Davenport! what’s the meaning of
this, anyway?” questioned Jack, putting on as
bold a front as he could.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t your father already told you what I
intend to do?” demanded the oil man.</p>

<p>“He told me you demanded a lot of money
of him.”</p>

<p>“So I did, Jack Rover. And I intend to get
it—a whole lot of money.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you want some money out of
my father too,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” answered Tate. “If you want
to know some of the particulars I’ll tell you.
We’re asking fifty thousand dollars for the release
of Jack Rover, fifty thousand dollars for
the release of Fred Rover and fifty thousand
dollars for the release of Andy Rover and Randy
Rover. That’s a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars for the bunch.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Then you think my two cousins are
worth twice as much as my brother and I, eh?”
asked the irrepressible Andy, with a faint grin.</p>

<p>“Pah, Andy Rover! Don’t make fun of it!”
snarled Davenport. “It’s nothing to laugh at.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
If you don’t like the price we’ve put on you and
your brother we can easily raise it to fifty thousand
apiece.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Tate. “Then we’d
have fifty thousand dollars more to divide between
us,” and he smiled wickedly.</p>

<p>“This high-handed proceeding may get you in
hot water, Davenport,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to take the risk. Now that we’ve
got you again I’ll see to it personally that you’ll
never get back to your folks again until that
money is paid.”</p>

<p>“Suppose our folks can’t raise the money?”
questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“I happen to know that they can raise it,”
answered the oil man. “Your folks are rich.
They have made barrels of money out of their
transactions in Wall Street and in the West and
down in the oil fields. They can pay that hundred
and fifty thousand dollars easily enough,
and they are going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Have you already made a demand for the
money?” asked Randy.</p>

<p>“We have.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they won’t pay it, what then?” questioned
Andy.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll put the screws on you boys until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
you send word to your folks that they’ve got to
pay.”</p>

<p>“And if we won’t send word, what then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll send word all right enough before
we get through with you,” replied Davenport
suggestively.</p>

<p>Then the boys were hustled back into their
prison and additional chains were placed upon
the logs. After that a regular guard was stationed
at the entrance to the cave, so that another
escape would be impossible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<small>ANOTHER DEMAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A week dragged wearily by and the four
Rover boys still found themselves prisoners of
Carson Davenport and his gang.</p>

<p>During that time they had been given no chance
to escape. For two days they were kept in the
close confinement of the cave and after that they
were taken out each day for several hours so
that they might enjoy the fresh air and the sunshine.
But when this was done each had his
hands tied behind him and was fastened by a rope
to one of the trees while not less than two of the
men sat near by, guns handy, to guard them.</p>

<p>“Gee, we couldn’t be any worse off if we were
in a regular prison,” was the way Randy expressed
himself.</p>

<p>“If we were in a regular prison I think the
food would be better,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>For the first three days the food supplied to
them had been fairly good. But now it was
becoming worse every day. That morning they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
had had the vilest of coffee and bread that was
musty and old, and the previous evening the stew
offered to them had made the twins sick.</p>

<p>They were satisfied that Davenport and his
crowd were negotiating with not only the twins’
father but with the fathers of Jack and Fred.
But they were given only a slight inkling of
how matters were progressing. Then they heard
the oil man tell Jackson and Tate that he expected
Booster to arrive soon.</p>

<p>“And as soon as he comes we’ll put the screws
on the boys. That will bring their folks to
terms,” said Davenport.</p>

<p>The next day the fellow called Booster put in
an appearance, and despite the wig he was wearing
the boys to their surprise recognized the young
man who had introduced himself as Joe Brooks.
The confidence man smiled grimly when Jack
spoke to him.</p>

<p>“I fooled you kids pretty neatly, didn’t I, in
New York and in Chicago?” said Joe Booster,
for that was his real name. “You never suspected
that I was in with Davenport, did you?”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know Fatty Hendry at all,
do you?” put in Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I met him once,” answered the confidence
man carelessly. “I palmed myself off as a friend
of one of his cousins and got him to lend me ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
dollars. That was when I was pretty well down on
my uppers.”</p>

<p>Davenport, Tate, Jackson and Booster had a
long conversation and then the four rascals came
again to the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you making out?” asked Booster
pleasantly. “They give you pretty good grub,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s getting worse every day,” answered
Fred bluntly.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought they were giving you genuine
mocha coffee,” went on the confidence man.</p>

<p>“Giving us dishwater!” retorted Andy.</p>

<p>“And fine stew, too!”</p>

<p>“It made me sick yesterday,” came from Randy.</p>

<p>“Well, you listen to us,” put in Davenport.
“Unless you’re willing to do what we want you
to, the grub is going to be a good deal worse
instead of better. More than that, we’ll keep you
in the cave all the time.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want us to do?” questioned
Jack, although he already had an idea on that
subject.</p>

<p>“We want all of you boys to write a letter
to your fathers, stating that they had better pay
the money that we have demanded of them and
that otherwise you are afraid of what may happen
to you. You can tell them that so far you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
have had the best of food and the best of treatment
generally, but that you have been threatened
with starvation if the money isn’t forthcoming.
We want all of you to make that letter just as
strong as you can. You write the letter,” he
went on, pointing to Jack, “and all of you sign
it with your full names, so that your folks will
know it’s a genuine communication.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Davenport, but I’m not writing
any such letter,” declared Jack flatly.</p>

<p>“Neither am I,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added the twins in concert.</p>

<p>“You will write it!” bellowed Davenport, his
anger rising swiftly. “If you don’t write it I’ll
give each of you a horsewhipping.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Tate.</p>

<p>“Give ’em a licking and no supper,” added
Jackson.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll have to whip ’em,” came
from Joe Booster, who did not believe in violence
of any sort. “Just let ’em go without their supper,
and their breakfast to-morrow morning.
Maybe then they’ll sing a different tune.”</p>

<p>“I owe ’em a licking for all the things they’ve
done against me,” growled Davenport.</p>

<p>“Never mind. It will be enough after we get
hold of that money,” returned Booster. “Just
cut ’em off from the eats. That’s the way you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
can bring anybody to terms. I’ve tried it before,
and I know.”</p>

<p>“All right then,” said the oil man shortly. And
then he and his cronies left the cave.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re a nice bunch, I don’t think!”
came from Andy, when the four boys found
themselves alone.</p>

<p>“Going to starve us, eh?” muttered Fred. “Do
you think they’ll dare do it?”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if they’d dare to do anything,”
came from Jack. “Gee, it’s too bad we
didn’t make our escape when we had the chance.”</p>

<p>Randy looked toward the entrance of the cave
to make certain that all of the men had departed.</p>

<p>“Let’s try to get away again to-night,” he
whispered. “It’s our one hope.”</p>

<p>“I hope our dads don’t turn over that money
to them,” went on Jack, his eyes flashing angrily.
“That bunch oughtn’t to have a hundred and
fifty cents, much less a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. Such a demand is the worst kind
of a hold-up.”</p>

<p>“Well, such demands have been made before,
and the money has been paid, too,” answered
Fred. “Don’t you remember that case of the
fellow that was held by the bandits in Algeria,
and the case of the two girls who were held by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
the Mexican bandits? Their folks had to come
across. Otherwise those people would have been
put out of the way.”</p>

<p>Supper time came, but no food was brought
to the boys. They, however, were given a bucket
of drinking water by Ocker.</p>

<p>“Davenport didn’t want you to have this,”
whispered the man, as he handed the water in.
“But I told him I wouldn’t stand for letting you
kids go thirsty. It’s bad enough to make you
go without the eats.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for so much sympathy anyhow,
Ocker,” returned Jack, and then went on quickly:
“Why does a nice fellow like you stand in with
such a bunch as Davenport’s crowd? Why don’t
you cut them and help us to get away? We can
make it well worth your while.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare do it, Rover,” muttered the
man. “They’d never forgive me, and they’d be
sure to get me sooner or later. I’m kind of
sorry that I stood in with ’em, just the same,”
and then, as Tate appeared at the entrance of
the cave, Ocker walked away hastily.</p>

<p>“Gee, maybe we can work on that fellow’s
sympathies and get him to help us,” was Randy’s
comment.</p>

<p>“Maybe if we make him a worth-while offer
he’ll help us to escape,” put in his twin. “Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
if they got the money from our folks it isn’t
likely that Davenport, Tate and Jackson, along
with that Booster, would let Ocker or Digby
have any great amount of it.”</p>

<p>The boys wondered what their folks were doing.
Of course, they knew nothing about Dick
Rover and Sam joining Tom in Maporah.</p>

<p>Davenport, through Booster, had kept a close
watch and reported the arrival at Maporah of
the fathers of Jack and Fred. Thereupon a demand
had been made upon the three older Rovers
for the money, which was to be paid in cash.
It was to be placed in a package under a tree
along Sunset Trail, and the Rovers were to take
care that no one was to be in that vicinity during
the night or early morning under penalty of an
attack from ambush. As soon as the package
was safely received by the Davenport crowd the
four boys were to be released and set on their
way toward Gold Hill.</p>

<p>“Those fellows certainly know what they
want,” said Sam Rover to his two brothers.
“What are we to do about it?” All efforts to
locate the boys had failed and their fathers were
frantic, not knowing how to turn or what to
do next.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Renton and Mr. Parkhurst,
the heavy stockholders in the Rolling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Thunder mine, had reached Maporah and there
had a short but effective interview with Tom
Rover.</p>

<p>“I’ll take charge of things here,” declared Mr.
Renton, when he had heard about the boys being
held for ransom. “I think I know exactly
how to handle Garrish. You go ahead and look
for those kids. Garrish won’t get away from
me, and neither will the Rolling Thunder mine.”
And thereupon Tom turned matters over to the
other stockholders who had agreed to act with
him.</p>

<p>The water brought to them by Ocker satisfied
the boys’ thirst but it did not allay their hunger,
and as hour after hour passed and none of their
captors presented himself, the lads began to grow
desperate.</p>

<p>“I wish I had an ax! I’d try to smash down
those logs,” declared Andy. “We might be able
to make a rush for it in the dark.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea! I wonder we didn’t think
of it before,” said Jack in a low tone. “Here,
Randy and Andy, stand back to back and give
me a chance to climb up on your shoulders.
When I’m up there, Fred, you hand me the lantern.
I’m going to inspect those cracks overhead
and see if I can’t find some sort of an opening
up there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>The young major, having removed his shoes,
was soon standing upright on the shoulders of
the twins. Fred passed up the lantern, and Jack
had the twins move slowly from one part of the
rocky cavern to another.</p>

<p>For a long while Jack found nothing that
looked promising, but presently he discovered a
stone that seemed to be loose. He told those
below to be on the watch and pulled and tugged
at the bowlder with all his might. It came down
with a crash and a number of loose stones and
some dirt followed. Jack immediately leaped
down and threw himself on the ground, the
others following his example.</p>

<p>“Hi there! What are you fellows doing?”
came from the entrance to the cave in Jackson’s
voice.</p>

<p>“A loose stone came down! It nearly smashed
us!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stay here if the roof is coming
down on us,” wailed Fred.</p>

<p>“Do as we told you to and you won’t have to
stay there,” answered Jackson, and then, after
waiting a few minutes more, the man disappeared
from the entrance.</p>

<p>Once more Jack mounted to the shoulders of
the twins and with caution he poked at the hole
which had been started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“Take off your jacket, Fred, and catch the
loose stones so that they don’t make any noise,”
he whispered. And this the youngest Rover did.</p>

<p>It was a long, tedious task, and several times
the young major was on the point of giving up.
But just when he felt that his labors were of
no avail he broke through an opening overhead.
Immediately the cool night wind struck him and
he realized that he had reached the outer air.</p>

<p>Again their gymnastic training stood the lads
in good stead. Jack hauled Fred up and then
held him still higher, and soon the youngest
Rover had crawled through the opening above.</p>

<p>“I’m right here among a lot of bushes,” he
whispered, looking down. “It’s a side hole, so
there isn’t much danger of its caving in.”</p>

<p>Fred leaned down and assisted Jack up, and
then the two cut a long heavy stick and with this
assisted the twins to get out of the cave, bringing
Jack’s shoes with them. They were but a short
distance away from the camp of the men and
could hear them talking quite plainly.</p>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, the four boys
crawled through the brushwood until they reached
something of a trail. They could see little, owing
to the darkness, but managed to make fair progress.</p>

<p>“Thank fortune, we’re out of that!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Jack presently. “Now we’ve got to see to it that
they don’t catch us again.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” answered Randy. Then, looking up
at the sky, he continued: “See how dark it is—not
a star showing. I think it’s going to rain.”</p>

<p>He was right, and in a few minutes more the
first of the drops began to come down. Then
came a dim flash of lightning, followed presently
by a vivid streak across the heavens.</p>

<p>“We’re in for a regular thunder storm,” said
Fred. “Gee, I hope the lightning doesn’t strike
us.”</p>

<p>On and on went the boys, bumping into more
than one tree and sometimes going headlong over
the rocks. They had but one purpose in mind—to
put as much space as possible between themselves
and the Davenport gang.</p>

<p>At last, having moved along for over an hour
and being soaked to the skin, they came to rest
under the shelter of a rocky precipice. The
storm continued, vivid flashes of lightning being
followed by claps of thunder that echoed and re-echoed
through the mountains.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go on,” said Jack, at last. “As
soon as daylight comes those fellows will be
searching for us, and they’ll have a big advantage
for they’ll be on horseback while we’ll be
on foot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>Forward they went again, although in what
direction they did not know. They were hoping
that they were getting farther and farther away
from the cave where they had been held captive.</p>

<p>They were passing along the sloping side of
the mountain when another flash of lightning
followed by a loud clap of thunder startled them
and brought them again to a halt. Then came
another crash as a tree toppled down not far
away.</p>

<p>“Gee, that was close enough!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when the four boys
were startled by a yell of fright. A few seconds
later came a man’s voice crying piteously:</p>

<p>“Help! Help! For the love of heaven, help!
I’m caught fast under the tree and I’ll be crushed
to death! Help!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<small>THE ROUND-UP—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Somebody’s in trouble! We’ll have to see
if we can’t help him!”</p>

<p>“Beware! It may be one of the Davenport
crowd.”</p>

<p>“That may be true, but we can’t let him die.
Come on.”</p>

<p>Another flash of lightning lit up the scene, and
by this the Rover boys saw where a tall tree of
the mountainside had been broken off. The top
hung down over some sharp rocks and under
several limbs rested the form of a man, held
down so that he could do little but kick frantically
with one leg.</p>

<p>“It’s Ocker!” exclaimed Fred, as they drew
closer.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” came faintly from the man as
he saw the dim forms of the boys in the darkness.
“Help! I’m being crushed to death!”</p>

<p>Fully realizing that they might be playing into
the hands of their enemies and yet not willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
to see Ocker crushed to death, <a href="#i_frontis">the four lads</a>
sprang forward and <a href="#i_frontis">began to tug at the tree</a>
branches which held the fellow a prisoner. They
could see that any instant the top of the tree
might break away entirely from the trunk and
then Ocker would be crushed to a pulp.</p>

<p>It was strenuous work, but the military experiences
of the former cadets stood them in good
stead, and now, as the twins and Jack raised one
limb after another, Fred propped them up with
such stones as were handy so that they could not
slip back. Then, while the twins continued to
exert pressure on the treetop, Jack hauled Ocker
away.</p>

<p>The man was bruised and bleeding and for
the moment so winded he could scarcely speak.
At first he had not recognized his rescuers and
he stared in astonishment when another flash of
lightning revealed their faces.</p>

<p>“You!” he gasped hoarsely. “You! And I
was helping to keep you prisoners!”</p>

<p>“Ocker, we have saved your life, and you
know it,” answered Jack quickly. “Now then,
it is up to you to help us escape. Will you do
it?”</p>

<p>“I sure will!” panted the man. “I’m done with
that crowd, anyhow. I told Davenport I wasn’t
brought up to do such dirty work as he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
planned.” Ocker paused to regain his breath.
“Why, Davenport is as bad a skunk as Pete
Garrish!”</p>

<p>“Pete Garrish!” exclaimed Randy. “Do you
know anything about that man?”</p>

<p>“I know everything about him,” muttered
Ocker. “He and his crowd are trying to swindle
your father and some other men out of their
interest in the Rolling Thunder mine.”</p>

<p>“You come with us, Ocker, and you won’t regret
it,” put in Jack hurriedly. “Show us the
way to Cal Corning’s house.”</p>

<p>For an instant the man hesitated.</p>

<p>“If I take you back where you belong, you
won’t have me arrested, will you?” he pleaded.
“I don’t want to hurt you fellows, and I’d just
as lief tell Mr. Rover what I know about Garrish.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be arrested,” answered Jack. “I’ll
give you my word on it. Come—hurry up! We
not only want to get back, but we want to have a
chance to round those other fellows up.”</p>

<p>“But don’t do it before I’ve a chance to get
away!” And the man’s face showed his sudden
terror.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll give you your chance, and
we’ll make it worth your while, too,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>Ocker had been on foot, not daring to take
his horse when he had stolen away from the Davenport
crowd. He led the way to a broader and
better trail, and less than half an hour later found
the whole crowd on Sunset Trail. By this time
the storm was passing and only a few scattering
raindrops were coming down.</p>

<p>That tramp was one the Rover boys never
forgot. Soaked to the skin, and so footsore they
could scarcely walk, they reached Cal Corning’s
place at about five o’clock in the morning. Their
knock on the door brought Corning to that portal,
gun in hand.</p>

<p>“Why—why, it’s the Rover boys!” called out
the man, in amazement. “Hurrah! Mr. Rover!
Mr. Rover! The boys are here, safe and sound!”
he yelled.</p>

<p>It was then that pandemonium seemed to break
loose. From a couple of the bedrooms rushed
Tom Rover followed quickly by Sam and Dick.
The men were partly dressed, having removed
only their coats and shoes.</p>

<p>“My boys! My boys!” cried Tom Rover, and
there was almost a sob in his throat as he rushed
to embrace the twins. Then Dick ran to Jack
and Sam to Fred, and there was a genuine hugging
match all around.</p>

<p>“Gee, but it’s good to be back!” was the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
Andy expressed himself, and each of the other
lads endorsed that sentiment.</p>

<p>“We were out looking for you until the storm
came up,” said Dick Rover. “We were going out
again as soon as it was daylight.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been and what did those
rascals do to you?” questioned Sam Rover.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, Dad,” answered Fred, and
then he added quickly: “Here’s a man you’ll like
to see, Uncle Tom. His name is Ocker, and he
knows all about Peter Garrish.”</p>

<p>“Did he find you?” questioned Tom quickly.</p>

<p>“No. We found him—under a tree that was
struck by lightning,” put in Jack quickly. “We’ll
give you the particulars in a little while. Just
now we want to know if you don’t want to get
a crowd together to go after Davenport and his
bunch. Those men ought to be rounded up and
put back in prison.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll round them up if it can be done,”
announced Dick Rover.</p>

<p>All entered the house, and very soon the boys
and the others were provided by the Corning
sisters with a substantial breakfast. While eating,
the lads told their story and then the men
questioned Ocker.</p>

<p>The good luck of the Rover boys in escaping
from the cave and falling in with the man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
had guided them to the Corning place was followed
directly after breakfast by more good luck.
Two cowboys and six miners, including Lew
Billings and Hank Butts, came riding by the place
and were immediately halted and told what was
in the air. These men at once agreed to join
the others in an attempt to bring Davenport and
his cohorts to justice.</p>

<p>“I want to go along,” said Jack to his father
when the posse was ready to start, and the other
lads echoed that sentiment, and somewhat against
the wishes of their parents the four boys joined
the men in the hunt for the rascals.</p>

<p>The round-up lasted until sundown, when Davenport,
Tate and Jackson were located by part
of the crowd under Dick Rover. Several shots
were exchanged and Davenport received a slight
wound in the shoulder. Then the three men held
up their hands in token of surrender.</p>

<p>In the meantime the boys and some of the other
men managed to catch Digby and Booster. The
young man who had so imposed upon the lads
in New York and Chicago did his best to get
away and then tried to show fight. But Jack
promptly knocked him down by a smashing blow
on the jaw, and when Booster got up again Randy
hit him in the ear and Fred got behind him so
that when Andy gave the fellow a shove he went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
down flat on his back with a thud. Then he was
captured and his hands were bound tightly behind
him.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll play any more confidence
games in a hurry,” said Jack. And he was right,
for as a result of his participation in the plot
against the boys, Joe Booster, as well as Digby,
was sent to prison for a number of years.</p>

<p>Davenport, Tate and Jackson looked much
crestfallen when confronted by the lads and their
fathers. They were fearful of being lynched,
knowing that some of the miners and cowboys
might be in favor of such a proceeding. They
were glad when the sheriff was called and they
were taken off to the county jail. They, too,
were sentenced to prison for long terms.</p>

<p>From Ocker Tom Rover was able to gain
much information regarding Peter Garrish and
his method of running the Rolling Thunder mine.
As a result of this and the action of Tom and
several of the other large stockholders Garrish
was compelled to cancel a contract he had made
with the ore company in which he and his friends
were interested and was likewise made to surrender
some stock which he had appropriated.
Then he was allowed to retire, a poorer if not
a wiser man.</p>

<p>Because of what he had done for the boys and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
for Tom, Ocker was not prosecuted. Instead,
the Rovers gave him sufficient money to buy his
passage to the gold fields of Alaska where, they
hoped, he would turn over a new leaf and make
a real man of himself.</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t get that hundred and fifty
thousand dollars after all!” chuckled Randy after
the rascals had been rounded up and the boys
were safe once more at Cal Corning’s house.</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t get it,” answered his father.
“Just the same, we were ready to pay it in case
we couldn’t get any trace of you.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was a strenuous experience—being
kept prisoners in that cave on the mountainside,”
said Jack. “I don’t believe we’ll ever have
such a thrilling thing happen again.” But Jack
was mistaken. More thrilling days were in store
for the four lads, and what these were will be
related in another volume, to be entitled “The
Rover Boys Winning a Fortune.”</p>

<p>During the week the boys had spent as prisoners
a number of letters had come for them, including
communications from their mothers and
from the girls, and also letters from Gif, Spouter
and Phil Franklin.</p>

<p>“Well, the girls are having a good enough
time,” said Jack, who was reading a letter from
Ruth. “And I’m glad of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose they’ll be coming home soon, now
that the Davenport crowd are rounded up,” returned
Fred.</p>

<p>“Here’s good news from Phil Franklin!” burst
out Andy. “He’s found the silver trophy.
Fished it up out of the lake two days after he
sent that last letter.”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” cried his twin. “Now we
won’t have that on our minds any more,” and
his face showed his satisfaction. “Now if only
we could get a new cannon for Colonel Colby, to
replace the one that busted, we’ll be all right.”
And let me add here that later on Jack’s father
did obtain a new piece from the government and
it was installed on the Military Academy campus
with much ceremony.</p>

<p>And now, while the Rover boys are talking
about their friends and discussing the finding
of the silver trophy, and their adventures while
prisoners on the mountainside, we will say
good-by.</p>

<p>In this line of books there is revealed the whole workings of a
great American railroad system. There are adventures in abundance—railroad
wrecks, dashes through forest fires, the pursuit of a
“wildcat” locomotive, the disappearance of a pay car with a large
sum of money on board—but there is much more than this—the
intense rivalry among railroads and railroad men, the working out
of running schedules, the getting through “on time” in spite of
all obstacles, and the manipulation of railroad securities by evil
men who wish to rule or ruin.</p>
